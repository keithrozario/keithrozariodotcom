Each challenge has 2 parts, and you must solve part 1 before the part 2 is revealed. Part 2 is harder than Part 1, and usually requires re-writes to solve. Sometimes quite extensive rewrites, and others they are small incremental steps.</p><p>If you haven't done these challenges before, I encourage you to try. None of them are easy (at least to me), but all of them solvable with enough elbow grease and time.</p><p>That said, the challenges are still contrived. Firstly, the questions are much better written that what you'd see in a Jira ticket or requirements document,. They include a detailed description of what must be done, and sample inputs and outputs you can test. Secondly, the challenges extend beyond what most coders do on a daily basis, one challenge required writing a small program to 'defrag' a disk, another required building a tiny assembler that ran it's own program, and multiple questions involved you navigating a 2D maze with obstacles along the way. All fun things you will probably <strong><span style=text-decoration:underline>not</span></strong> do as a programmer in the real world.</p><p>I took on the challenges, both to improve my coding skills, and to learn how I could use coding assistants like in these <em>close</em> to real-world scenarios. The hope was I would gain some insight into how I could use these tools more effectively should I need to do something more than solving contrived programming challenges before Christmas.</p><p>OK. Background complete.</p><p>Let's move onto the challenge that changed the way I would look at LLMs forever.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/keithrozariodotcom/2025/03/what-challenge-13-taught-me-about-llms./>[]</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://keithrozario.github.io/keithrozariodotcom/2025/02/things-i-read-over-and-over-again/>Things I read over and OVER again</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2025-02-26</time></div><div class=post-content><p>A list of articles/post/videos I come back to over and over again.</p><ul class=wp-block-list><li><a href=https://danlebrero.com/2022/03/23/but-life-had-other-plans>https://danlebrero.com/2022/03/23/but-life-had-other-plans</a></li><li><a href=https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/ideal-candidate/ target=_blank rel=noopener title="The Ideal Candidate will get punched in the stomach">https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/ideal-candidate/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go" target=_blank rel=noopener title>Raymond Hettinger Transforming code into beautiful Python</a></li></ul><p></p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/keithrozariodotcom/2025/02/things-i-read-over-and-over-again/>[]</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://keithrozario.github.io/keithrozariodotcom/2025/01/overcoming-setbacks-progress/>Overcoming Setbacks = Progress</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2025-01-04</time></div><div class=post-content><p>We've all seen the "tiny gains post".
