There's been a lot of talk lately on Malaysia sending a second Angkasawan into space. Unfortunately, we don't seem to be getting our moneys worth, the Angkasawan program has done nothing to stop the slide in our Scientific literacy in Malaysia, in fact, if the graph above is anything to go by it's actually made the it worse.

One of the key reasons always cited to support the Angkasawan program is to promote the understanding of science and maths in Malaysia--unfortunately, the Angkasawan program seems to have a negative effect on our international test scores for science. I wonder why? I've made a video on why the angkasawan project was a waste of time, check it out here.
