Crowdsourcing has come to the Asia Pacific region--and it's come in a big way. A couple of months back, I was contacted by the people organizing Crowdsourcing week in Singapore to attend the event, unfortunately due to personal commitments I was unable to make it--bummer!

Crowdsourcing week is a great idea that brings a whole bunch of great speakers including <a title="Jenn Gustetic" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jenngustetic" target="_blank">Jennifer Gustetic</a>, an executive at the "Challenges and Prizes" program in NASA, Stephanie Grosser from USAID and Sean Moffit from Wikibrands. It's also one of the first events on crowdsourcing that I know off occurring in the Asia Pacific region and if you're in the neighbourhood I can almost guarantee it'll be worth your time attending.

So if you're interested in listening to topics like <em>"Everyone can be rocket scientist: Prizes and Challenges at NASA"</em> from someone working in NASA, or<em> "Equity Crowdfunding: Next Big Thing"</em> from someone working in the crowdfunding platform crowdcube.com, then head on over to <a title="Crowdsourcing Week 2013" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5315215954/partner/58720666353" target="_blank">registration page</a>, and register yourself.

Oh, and by the way, if you think the tickets prices are a bit too expensive, try the promo code "<strong>KE3130</strong>" for a 15% discount for tickets to crowdsourcing week--on me!!

Or for further browsing, try checking out the <a title="Crowdsourcing Week Schedule" href="http://crowdsourcingweek.com/schedule/" target="_blank">Crowdsourcing week agenda here</a>.

Have a good time folks--pity I can't join.

Just as a shameless plug, you can check out my two post on the crowdsourcing week website below:
