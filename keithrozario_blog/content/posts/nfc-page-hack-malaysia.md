The National Feedlot Corporation have had a lot of bad luck lately, but I guess when you get an RM250 Million dollar government loan when you're wife is a Government minister--you've probably already had your fair share of good luck.

With the recent arrest of Rafizi Ramli, the up and coming PKR young gun--the SGP Cyber Army decided enough was enough.

Who is Rafizi you ask? He's the guy who <strong>debated with Khairy in the UK</strong>, he's the guy who <strong>spearheaded the attack against the NFC</strong>, he's the guy<strong> revealing documents about George Kent and the LRT project</strong>, and he's the guy proposing <strong>abolishing the ridiculously high taxes Malaysians pay for cars</strong>. Yeah--all of that comes from one guy--Rafizi, and right now he's being charged under a law no one except Bankers give a crap about.

So with his recent arrest, some hackers in his defense--decided to go on offense, and they set their eyes clearly on a big target--<em>no not Sharizat</em>--but the NFC website, and boy did they hack it well.<!--more-->

Malaysiakini reported the NFC website hacked at 10:40am yesterday. The site remain hacked well into the evening, going down at about 8-9pm by my reckoning, and even then by merely disabling the IIS.

So how did the SGP cyber army do it? I'm not entirely sure, but what I do know is this:
<blockquote>1. The NFC Website runs on Wordpress 3.3.1 (or should I say 'ran'). That's not the latest version. However, unless it's a multi-site instance I don't think there were any discovered vulnerabilities with Wordpress 3.3.1. My blog isn't up to date either.

2.<a title="Whois NFC.com.my" href="http://whois.domaintools.com/nfc.com.my" target="_blank"> The NFC website is hosted on Exabytes</a>. A Malaysian hosting company (pretty good one at that)

3. Judging by the error message I receive now when visiting the site, it seems to be running on IIS (and hence Windows).</blockquote>
However, besides the obvious point of how they did it, what they did was equally entertaining:

<a title="NFC Page Hacked: Google Cache" href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Pu2Cps64iBYJ:www.nfc.com.my/+nfc&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=my" target="_blank">Click here to view the google cache version</a> of what the site looked like after it was hacked.

In case the Google cache isn't working, then you <a title="NFC Malaysia Hacked by SGP cyber Army" href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bxr9pDWP2zrdRHdGbDZqVmdXODQ" target="_blank">download a snapshot I created of the Google Cache of the hacked NFC Malaysia Page</a>.
