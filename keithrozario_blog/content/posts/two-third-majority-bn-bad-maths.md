I wrote recently about the sad state of <a title="Science Education in Malaysia — it just sucks!" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2012/12/science-education-malaysia-timss.html" target="_blank">Science Education in Malaysia</a>, now I'm beginning to see some examples of really bad Mathematics as well.

Bernama today reported that:

<blockquote>

BN has the ability to obtain a two-third majority in the 13th general election (GE), that is expected any time soon, Department of Special Affairs (Jasa) director-general Fuad Hassan said.

He said to garner<strong> two-third majority</strong>, BN needs to draw at least <strong>30 percent votes from the Chinese</strong> voters, and respectively <strong>65 percent from the Malay and Indian</strong> voters, nationwide.

</blockquote>

Now for the most part that sounds about right, until you realize that a two-third majority is 66% (well to be technically accurate it's 66.66666...7%). Now how is it possible to garner a 66% majority if you only get 30% of the Chinese vote? More importantly, how do you get 66% of the total seats if you're aiming for just 65% from the Malays and Indians. So you get 66% of the seats in Parliament without even having 66% of the popular vote....

Hmmm, this is either gerry-mandering, or someone in the Department of Special Affairs must have missed school the day they thought percentages.
