One of the reasons I starte![](/uploads/resume-300x242.jpg "resume")d this blog was to try out new things and see if I could land a job with an impressive website. I love my current job, but it's a bit unstable, so I'd thought it'll be wise to remain marketable. It's one thing to tell people I'm a Business Analyst with strong technical skills, and a whole other thing to display a full blown webpage with yourname.com.

So I searched the web for resume templates, my initial idea was to have 2 wordpress themes. One for the main blog, another for the resume. However, I discovered it'll be a whole lot easier to just find a CSS/HTML template and copy that to a separate location and link it from my blog.<!--more-->

So that's what I did:

1) Step 1:Find an online resume template (or create one yourself)
2) Step 2:Upload to '/Resume' on your domain
3) Step 3:Tweak contents
4) Step 4:Link from main blog.

Finding the resume was easy enough and so was uploading. I haven't gotten around to tweaking the contents, but I had a massive problem trying to link it from my main blog. I couldn't find a decent plugin to display both a image and a short description. So I had to learn some CSS, and tweak some code. I had a real tough time figuring out why my &lt;div&gt;'s weren't dividing properly, till I figured out I had to include a <em>clear: both</em> tag at the bottom of the div for it to look neat.

It took me a while, but eventually I figured it out, and my website has endured yet another milestone. Plus I learnt CSS along the way :)
