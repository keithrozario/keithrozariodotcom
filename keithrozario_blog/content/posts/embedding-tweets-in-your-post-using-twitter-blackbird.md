The tweet will then appear prominently and with all it's formatting intact (if the tweeter had a black background, the backgroud would appear as part of the tweet...AWESOME!).<!--more-->

Here's an example from a tweeter we all know:

[blackbirdpie id="84789682231181312"]

The app is just gloriously simple to exectue, once you install the app, it'll place a little black-bird icon on your dashboard such as:

<a title="Twitter Blackbird" href="/uploads/Twitter-Blackbird.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1007" title="Twitter Blackbird" src="/uploads/Twitter-Blackbird-300x125.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="125" /></a>

Clicking on the black-bird icon opens up a pretty straight-forward menu to embed those tweets into your wordpress blog post. Happy Tweeting.
