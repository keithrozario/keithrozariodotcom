Security Analyst today reported that as many as <a title="Linkedin passwords hacked" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/257045/update_linkedin_confirms_account_passwords_hacked.html" target="_blank">6 million LinkedIn passwords have been leaked</a>, the 161 million strong Social network focused on creating professional relationships have since confirmed the leak and have taken steps to mitigate the issues.

Step 1: Click on the Name in the upper right hand corner of your screen, and then in the drop down box that pops out, click 'settings'. (the red circle in the picture below)Step 2: Click on the Change Password (the purple circle)--and you're done!
