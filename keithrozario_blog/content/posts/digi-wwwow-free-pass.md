Hey all, as many of you know I submitted my blog to the Digi WWWOW awards, and a couple of weeks back I received confirmation that my blog was top 10--woo hoo!!

Being nominated for the top 10 meant that I was invited for the awards night, and I got to bring as many as 3 guest. However, at the last minute 2 of my guest had to cancel and now I'm looking at possibly 2 empty seats at my table.

So rather than letting a good thing go to waste, I've decided to give out the 2 passes to the awards night, to my guest to the Digi WWWOW awards, all you have to do is follow me on twitter and tweet the following:
<blockquote>I want to go to #DigiWWWOW courtesy of @keithrozario http://bitly.com/MrJ9vG</blockquote>
I don't expect many takers, so your chances of winning would be ridiculously high--seriously! If you don't have twitter, you can also just leave a comment belong, and that would count as an entry as well. The winning entry would be picked at random, so no complaining if you don't get it, it's all random people!

The winner would be announced by midnight today, and I expect to contact you via twitter/email by tomorrow morning. Please also be sure you can be at the Digi Office in Shah Alam by 7pm , 9th of June (this saturday), otherwise you'd just be wasting the tickets.
<h2>Announcing the Winner!!</h2>
As the first (and only) participant of the competition, Mr. Shakir Ameer is the winner, I normally would say thanks to all who joined, but it looks like nobody (except Shakir) did.

Congratulations to Shakir, I've already contacted him. To the rest of the Digi WWWOW nominees, see you guys there.
