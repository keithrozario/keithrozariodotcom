Yesterday<a rel="attachment wp-att-957" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2011/06/youtube-gets-a-spanking-new-html5-interface.html/html5logo">![](/uploads/html5logo-150x87.jpg "html5logo")</a> I blogged about how youtube was experimenting with a html5 version of the site, today we got come-from-behind victory for skydrive who announced that they've already <strong>launched</strong> their html5 version of site. Skydrive is Microsofts answer to dropbox, but unfortunately, it fell short of the mark and personally I don't believe html5 is going to save this one.

I couldn't log into to skydrive today, so was unable to check out how cool it became, but if you've got a skydrive account why don't you give it a try and feedback.

This wonderful bit of skydrive info was brought to you by the wonderful people @ <a title="Gizmodo" href="http://gizmodo.com/5813836/microsoft-gives-their-dropbox+like-skydrive-an-html5-overhaul">Gizmodo</a>.<!--more-->
