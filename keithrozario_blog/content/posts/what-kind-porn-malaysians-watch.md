Let's be honest--Malaysians watch a lot of Porn.

On the outside, we may espouse our 'Asian' values and culture, but the cold-hard data suggest we're as horny as the Japanese. In one of my past post, I showed how we have evidence of someone using the <a title="Government Network used to download porn : Privacy is dead" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2013/04/malaysian-government-network-download-porn-privacy-dead.html">Government internet connection to download porn</a>.

Today however, PornMD the self-proclaimed "biggest porn search engine" released statistics as to what Malaysians were searching on their site. The results aren't that surprising, although I was quick shocked to see Tudung on there--apparently some people find it kinky.

Check out more on PornMD <a title="PornMD sex search" href="http://www.pornmd.com/sex-search" target="_blank">here</a>, or head on over to this report from Quartz that explains how a lot of <a title="East Asian fascination with Japanese Porn" href="http://qz.com/164834/popular-porn-search-terms-show-that-east-asia-has-a-serious-japan-fetish/" target="_blank">South-East Asians love Japanese Porn</a>. While you may consider Malaysians vile for searching for terms like Tudung and Rape on a porn search engine--consider though that at least we're not Pakistan, whose users searched for a far more disgusting "Girls peeing on Bed"--WTF!

<span style="color: #888888;"><em>Correction: A previous version of this post stated that the most downloaded torrent in Malaysia was a piece of Hentai, however a reader named Darkon commented that although the downloaded file was named Hentai Ouji, it was merely regular Japanese Anime, which wasn't categorized as porn. Good one Darkon!</em></span>
