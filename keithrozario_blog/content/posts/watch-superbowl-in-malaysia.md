<div>Got this email from the people over at Unotelly:</div>
<br>
<blockquote>
<div>I want to inform you that UnoTelly will allow people stream the NFL Super Bowl for free on <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1936190861"><span class="aQJ">Sunday, February 1</span></span>, regardless of where they live or whether they are UnoTelly subscribers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are offering free access to media stations (NBC Sports, Channel 4 and more) that will be broadcasting the Super Bowl for free. Visitors will not be required to sign up for a subscription, but simply need to submit their e-mail address. Please feel free to visit our Super Bowl page for more information:<a href="https://www2.unotelly.com/superbowl" target="_blank">https://www2.unotelly.com/<wbr />superbowl</a></div></blockquote>
<div> I trust UnoTelly---so if you're an American stuck in Malaysia, this is a free way to watch the SuperBowl--otherwise move along, there's nothing to see here.</div>
