This great app called Loads.in provide a simple straightforward interface to time your webpage load time from various locations across the globe.

Besides having a very apt url, loads.in actually has a great looking design. The app is design to do one thing and one thing only, and that's to let you know how many seconds your webpage will load depending on location. I found the app pretty impressive and would definitely recommend giving it a go to see how fast your page loads.
