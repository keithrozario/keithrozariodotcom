<a href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2011/05/taking-things-to-the-limit.html">![](/uploads/5052070022_73852a658e_o-100x150.jpg "The limit")</a> Facebook has a 5000 Friend limit, meaning you can't have more than 5000 facebook friends, and once you hit this limit Facebook won't let you have any more friends.

Being an excel guru, I knew that older versions of excel had a 65,536 row limit per worksheet. That meant you couldn't store more than 65,536 rows in excel, the geeks among us would recognize 65,536 as a 2 raised to the 16th power, so the number itself suggest it's a system limitation that prevented excel from exceeded 65,536 rows. Facebook on the other hand has a very nice round number of 5000. That suggests that is was  a very careful design consideration to limit the number of friends you have rather than some database limitation. Personally I don't even have 1,000 friends so it's unlikely to bother me, but it did bother quite a number of people who now have turned to fan pages to broadcast their message on facebook.<!--more-->

The topic though, got me wondering what other limits there were on the web:
