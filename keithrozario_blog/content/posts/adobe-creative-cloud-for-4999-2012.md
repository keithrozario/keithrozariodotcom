Adobe is looking to release a cloud version of their creative applications online called creativecloud. From what I gather from their website it looks to be like a office365 version for creatives. This is probably a step in the right direction, Adobe software usually run into the hundreds or thousands of dollars, and buying the licenses for that software usually incur a huge capital expenditure for startups looking use these applications.<!--more-->

Adobe creativecloud is looking to launch in the first half of this year, and promise among other things:
<blockquote><strong>All the Creative Suite desktop tools</strong>. Download and use any Creative Suite tool you choose, or work with other products you've been wanting to try — including <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom®</a> and new<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/">Adobe Edge</a> and <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/muse/">Adobe Muse</a>.

<strong>Cloud storage</strong>. Store up to 20GB of data that you can access from virtually anywhere.</blockquote>
Also Adobe is promising key components of their traditional licensed software into a subscription based model, their <a title="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> mentions the following components will be offered as part of their creativecloud offering:
<blockquote>Adobe Creative Cloud offers all your favorite Creative Suite desktop applications (Adobe Photoshop®, InDesign®, Illustrator®, Dreamweaver®, and more), new Adobe Touch Apps, and collaboration features that will enable you to go beyond content creation on the desktop to creating and publishing across channels and med</blockquote>
While it still sounds like you'll have to download and install the applications, the service is still pay as you go, meaning it's not strictly a cloud offering but rather a subscription based license for traditional applications. All for $49.99 a month (on a 12 month contract) isn't cheap, but it could be an alternative way to look at software as a operating expenditure rather than a capital expenditure and help startups and bootstrap companies take off without getting held down by expensive software cost.

So while technically it's not cloud computing (although I could be wrong), it does offer some advantages over spending thousands of dollars in a single purchase to use these applications.
