In case anyone needs my PGP key to send me encrypted e-mails. <a title="PGP Key" href="https://www.keithrozario.com/wp-content/special-uploads/keithRozario.asc" target="_blank">Here it is</a>.

e-mails should be sent to keith@keithrozario.com, which is hosted on Gmail, if you're uncomfortable with that, drop me an encrypted e-mail there, and I'll respond with a privately hosted e-mail you can connect with me on.

Regards,

Keith
