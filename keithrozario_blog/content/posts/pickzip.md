<a title="Pick&amp;Zip" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2011/08/pickzip.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1149 alignleft" title="PickNZip" src="/uploads/PickNZip.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="86" /></a><a title="Pick N Zip" href="http://www.picknzip.com" target="_blank">Pick&amp;Zip</a> is an amazing app that allows you to copy over your entire Facebook photo albums all at once in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one zip file</span>. The application even allows you to view ALL the photos you're tagged in and download those as well, especially apt if you're looking to migrate this stuff to Google+. It also act as a great picture viewer for all your photos on Facebook.

<!--more-->Using Pick &amp; Zip couldn't be easier:

1) Login with you facebook account,
2) Authorize the App
3) Click on the giant "Find My Photos" button
4) Select which albums/photos you want to download  <em>note: you need to select each individual photo in the album, but thankfully there's a select all button</em>
5) Select the Download Tab, and choose either PDF/ZIP, and you're good to go.

The app works great, and the speed is fantastic. The only downside is that I can't select a whole album at once but need to click each individual photo in the album. The album displays 20 photos at a time, and clicking select all only selects the 20 photos displayed. Small disadvantage to an otherwise superbly done app. Design looks a bit dated, but the site is functional, works the first time and intuitive enough to forgive this slight inconvenience.

Overall, Pick&amp;Zip is <strong>very much recommended. </strong>Visit the site @ <a title="Pick N Zip" href="http://www.picknzip.com" target="_blank">http://www.picknzip.com</a><strong>
