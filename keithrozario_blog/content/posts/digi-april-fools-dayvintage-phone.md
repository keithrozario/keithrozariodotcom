<p style="text-align: center;">![Digit Vintage Phone April Fools](/uploads/Digi_Vintage_Phone_April_Fools_3310.png "Digi_Vintage_Phone_April_Fools_3310")</p>
Everybody's favourite yellow Malaysian telco decided to start April Fools day a bit early today--either that or somebody in Digi went a bit crazy, and who can blame them with all those yellow men running around the office an' all.

Anyway, they offered a 'vintage' phone offer that includes phones like the Nokia 3310,  that comes with interchangeable covers, clock and alarm and best of all--<strong>an awesome snake game!!</strong> For the low low price of just Rm1499, you get the phone and 30GB of data--although that may a bit of challenge to use the Data, given that the phones pre-date not just 3G or LTE--but EDGE as well.

I personally enjoyed the joke, and actually reminisced about my old phones--ahhh those were the days.
