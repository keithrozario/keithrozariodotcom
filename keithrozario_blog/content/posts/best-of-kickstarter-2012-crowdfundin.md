![Number of Successful Kickstarter Projects in 2012](/uploads/The-Best-of-Kickstarter-2012-—-Kickstarter.png "The Best of Kickstarter 2012 — Kickstarter")

Crowdfunding is exploding, and kickstarter is exploding with it.

In 2012 alone, Kickstarter successfully helped start 18,109 projects, from pledges of nearly 300 million. That's a lot of cash from just random strangers hoping to help someone else realize their dreams, or to help the public in general.

Noteworthy projects include an <a title="Open Source Geiger Counter" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/year/2012#geiger_counter" target="_blank">open-source geiger counter to detect radiation levels in Japan</a>, a kickstarter initiative that released recordings of Classical music to the public domain and funding a <a title="Kickstarter Bus Stop in Georgia" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/year/2012#love_shack" target="_blank">Bus Stop in Georgia</a>.

Closer to home, my friend <a title="Kickstarter Malaysia: A collection of Malaysian Kickstarter Projects" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2012/07/only-heart-malaysia-kickstarter-crowdfunding.html" target="_blank">Dev didn't manage to kickstart his idea of Onlyheart</a> (although he's <a title="My Only Heart" href="http://myonlyheart.com/" target="_blank">launching it now without kickstarter funding</a>), I helped <a title="Iggyfied successfully kickstarted" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2013/01/iggyfied-successfully-kickstarted-music-igor-presnyakov.html" target="_blank">Igor successfully fund Iggyfied</a> and a Malaysian Author successfully kickstarted his book--<a title="Malaysian kickstarter success story" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2012/10/malaysia-kickstarter.html" target="_blank">and it's now on sale in MPH</a>.

What do you think of Kickstarter? Have any ideas that need funding?
