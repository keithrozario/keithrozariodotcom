<center><a href="/uploads/Malaysiakini.png">![](/uploads/Malaysiakini.png "Malaysiakini")</a></center><em><span style="color: #888888;">*Update: Malaysiakini have confirmed the update on their facebook page, looks like you need to look for other sources of Bersih 3.0  news, this could take a while. It's also note-worthy that 10 people 'like' this on facebook, obviously over-looking the fact that nobody should 'like' this.</span></em>

With barely 12 hours to go before Bersih 3.0 starts to swing into action, Malaysiakini servers appear to be down. I was trying to logon online to check the news only to notice that I couldn't access the site, PINGs to the site seem to time out as well. Could this be a repeat of when Malaysiakini went offline in the run up to the Sarawak elections? Plus, I know this doesn't affect me, because as a Google Chrome user I know <a title="http://lifehacker.com/5590582/google-chrome-tells-you-when-sites-are-down-for-other-users" href="http://lifehacker.com/5590582/google-chrome-tells-you-when-sites-are-down-for-other-users" target="_blank">when other users are also experiencing problems accessing a site</a>.

Take care people, Bersih isn't yet trending on twitter, but I think it's just a matter of time. Also I for those with smartphones I strongly encourage you to keep track of things via twitter rather than via Malaysiakini, twitter was built for these things.

Take for example the following:[blackbirdpie url="https://twitter.com/#!/AdrianNCF/status/195016613894963200"]
