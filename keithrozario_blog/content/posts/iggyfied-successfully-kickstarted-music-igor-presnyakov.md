I was getting a bit worried that this was yet another kickstarter failure, as I had just receive a couple of updates and nothing much else.

But then things got interesting, 2 weeks before Christmas I got a surprise package in the mail, and it was a beautifully packaged crisp IGGYFIED CD. I felt really good supporting a great musician and getting my name on a CD, this also happened to be my very first autographed CD, so all in all it was a good move.
