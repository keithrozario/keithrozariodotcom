<img src="/uploads/WooRank-150x81.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="102" /></a>My blog just turned 2 months old today, and boy has it come far. I've been trying real hard to make at least 1 Post a day, but most of the time it's about 1 post every 2-3 days. It's still a lot better than my previous blog and I've learnt a lot from my mistakes. However, just how good is keithrozario.com?

According to GoogleAnalytics, which I installed shortly after I created the blog, I maxed out at 28 hits a day, with a monthly average of about 12-14 hits a day this week. Quite bad when you compare me to guys like sethgodin who gets almost 80,000 hits/month or Anilnetto (a Malaysian journalist) who averages almost 1 million/month.<!--more-->

However, I'm still pretty proud of myself. This blog went from zero hits/day to 14hits/day in 2 months, hopefully next month I'll average 30 hits/day, and at least hit the 1000 hits/month barrier at the end of the year. It's still a long way more, at 14 hits/day I'm just at  420hits/month. It'll take some time and a lot of posting, but doubling my traffic from what it is now is top priority for my blogging. (my other project jomlunch.com has to take a back seat).

So how do you increase traffic? Well that's for a separate post, right now it's more important to find out exactly hos much traffic is coming to your site.

Today the guys over at <a title="SixRevision" href="http://www.sixrevisions.com" target="_blank">sixrevisions.com</a> gave us <a title="Productivity Web Tools" href="http://sixrevisions.com/tools/free-productivity-tools-web-pro/" target="_blank">10 free webtools for busy professionals</a>. It's a great article and I recommend you read it, however my favorite webtool from the list was <a title="Woo Rank" href="http://www.woorank.com/">WooRank</a>, this absolutely amazing SEO reporting tool that let's you know just how good your blog really is. The reporting gives you details like the amount of hits/month, the amount of pages on your website, whether your images are fine, the HTML compliance of your site, etc etc.

Then it does something amazing, it then gives you a <strong>woorank score</strong>. The higher the score the better your website, my current score is <a title="Woo Rank" href="http://www.woorank.com/en/www/keithrozario.com" target="_blank">40.1</a>, Anilnetto has a score of 67.6 and Seth Godin comes in at  58.4. Not bad at all.

Why don't you try out woorank and see what score your blog gets?
