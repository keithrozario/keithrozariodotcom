If you're looking at implementing a large scale cloud offering, something where you measure capacity in chunks of 100TB, then you might want to weigh in on the pros and cons of each possible Cloud provider.

Or you could just read 79 page protest Amazon filed in a US court claiming it's 'successful' bid on a CIA tender was legit, and IBM had no business going to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to get the CIA to re-tender.

While two cloud giants fighting it out in open court may not intrigue you, the documentation does highlight some of the results of the CIA evaluation, that show Amazon winning the bid by a substantial margin--substantial enough for the CIA to award the contract to AWS even though it's bid was 50% (or more than USD50million) higher.
