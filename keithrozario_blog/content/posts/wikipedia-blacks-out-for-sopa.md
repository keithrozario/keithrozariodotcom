I've posted a couple of post around SOPA and PIPA, and today there was a protest from one of the most web-traffic websites of all -- WIKIPEDIA.

Wikipedia, today was blacked out to protest SOPA and now you know. Every college student looking to do a term paper, every high school student looking for information on a term paper and if you're looking for just about anything online, you're going to see a blacked out wikipedia-- and so now you know about SOPA.

If you're looking for a way to work around the black-out though, visit this<a title="How to Get Around wikipedia blackout" href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/01/18/how-to-get-around-the-wikipedia-blackout/" target="_blank"> link</a> from the awesome website <a title="Naked Security" href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com" target="_blank">Naked Security</a>.
