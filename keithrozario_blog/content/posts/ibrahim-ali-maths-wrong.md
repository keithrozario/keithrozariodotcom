There's something terribly wrong, when a politician can't get his million, billions and trillions correct. <a title="Malaysian Insider Ibrahim Ali Rm1.4 Trillion" href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/stop-tppa-or-new-bumi-agenda-will-be-destroyed-perkasa-tells-najib" target="_blank">This</a> Malaysian Insider story has quoted my favorite bigot as saying:

[box icon="chat"]

“Right now, the GNI of Bumiputeras is <strong>RM56 million</strong>. So to achieve <strong>RM900 billion</strong> by 2020, the government must provide funds worth<strong> RM1.4 trillion</strong> to Bumiputeras,” he said.

</blockquote>

I'm pretty sure the 56 million is a typo or just a slip of the tongue, however the RM900 Billion requiring Rm1.4 Trillion, is some what of a 'calculator rosak' moment for Ibrahim Ali. Of course this begs the question---where will the additional RM500 Billion go?

All the more reason we should start teaching kids Maths and Science early in schools, cause even our good Friend Ibrahim Ali can't get his figures and sums correct.

Lain kali sebelum release Press Statement, belajarla sedikit matematik dulu!!
