![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-hAehGJWR5Y/SxeJCmS020I/AAAAAAAAAg8/-sQXbFzbync/s320/untitled.bmp)<br />Google Wave is supposed to be the next big thing on the internet.<br /><br />What a load???<br /><br />I can't figure out how to use it correctly. From what I figured sort of like having a group chat in Y!Messenger or MSN Communicator.<br /><br />Only difference is, that the information will be stored in offline, and you can upload stuff like photos and videos to it. And you can potentially add a lot of people to your wave and have a huge collaborative efforts.<br /><br />Sounds great, and I plan to create a wave that actually works.<br /><br />It sounds cool and has lots of potential, only problem is that very few people are on it.<br /><br />I have 16 invitations, that I'm giving out. If you want one let me know. Only catch is that you have to join my first wave.<br /><br />keithjosephrozario@gmail.com
