<a title="Who Calls me" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2011/10/find-out-who-missed-call-you.html/45841865_19e406ad07_o" rel="attachment wp-att-1311">![](/uploads/45841865_19e406ad07_o.jpg "Missed Call")</a>Social media and sites like twitter have done fantastically well to enable to arab uprising or finding bone marrow donors. However, a group of people decided to use social media to answer some fundamentally important question , or rather just one very important question...who missed call me?

The web site (very aptly named) <a title="http://whocallsme.com/" href="http://whocallsme.com/" target="_blank">whocallsme.com</a> allows user to post up missed calls from numbers they don't recognize and people with similar calls usually try to respond. The response rate is pretty good although it mostly focuses on calls from credit agencies (quite obvious once you think about it)<!--more-->

All in one it's another brilliant example of using crowdsourcing to find out who called you, and if it turns out you're late for a car payment....well at least you know not to pick it up the next time.

The web never ceases to amaze.
