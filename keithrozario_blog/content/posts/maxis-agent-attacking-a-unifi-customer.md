<p style="text-align: center;">![Writing an email to TMs CEO about my faulty Unifi](/uploads/Writing-an-email-to-TMs-CEO-about-my-faulty-Unifi.png)</p>
Just yesterday, I received a rather odd comment on my post about a <a title="Tm Ceo restore Unifi" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2012/02/email-ceo-restore-unifi-services.html#comment-1010183707" target="_blank">Unifi downtime</a>. It read:

[box icon="chat"]

The supposed 'name' of the commenter was 'Maxis Agent' and the email address given was maxis@maxis.com.my. I'm not entirely sure what to make of the comment, but this obviously wasn't the work of a Maxis agent. <a title="Email maxis agent" href="mailto:maxis@maxis.com.my" target="_blank"><strong>

More importantly it tried to make a rather silly point, that just because I haven't worked in customer service I shouldn't complain about customer service. You're right--I haven't worked in a customer service center, and for that matter, I'm quite certain I would find the job at a call center very challenging indeed.

But, I can't cook either--that doesn't mean I can't complain at a restaurant. I can't play badminton, that doesn't mean I can't get upset when Malaysia doesn't win the Thomas Cup, and I don't know how to renovate my house--that doesn't mean I can't complain about my house contractor.

When you complain to your chef that the soup is too salty--does he have the right to say, why don't you work in the kitchen first before complaining!!

I can complain--because I paid for a service, and when that service isn't up to my expectations--I have every right to voice out my dissatisfaction.

On a separate note, if you want to post a note anonymously, post it as anonymous, and I will defend your right to post whatever you want on my blog. I believe strongly in Freedom of speech. However, if you post something fraudulently, pretending to be a 'Maxis Agent' , when you obviously aren't, don't expect my sympathy.

That applies to you 'Maxis Agent' that posted on my blog at 7.18pm Malaysian time from IP Address 58.27.115.118. Why would a 'Maxis' agent, post from a<a title="Telekom Malaysia IP address" href="http://www.infosniper.net/index.php?ip_address=58.27.115.118&amp;map_source=1&amp;overview_map=1&amp;lang=1&amp;map_type=1&amp;zoom_level=7" target="_blank"> TM IP address</a>?
