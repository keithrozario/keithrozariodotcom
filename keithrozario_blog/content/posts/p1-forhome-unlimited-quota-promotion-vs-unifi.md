<blockquote><b>Petaling Jaya, (September 19, 2013) -</b><b> </b>To celebrate its 5<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, Packet One Networks (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (P1) invites all Malaysians to keep playing without limits by launching a special unlimited quota promotion for two of its award-winning wireless home broadband plans.

The ForHome<sup>TM</sup> 99 and 149 offers a speed up to 1Mbps and 2Mbps with unlimited quota for the affordable prices of just RM99 and RM149 respectively for a limited time only.

The amount of data measured in Kilobyte, Megabyte or Gigabyte determines what and how much you can do online. According to Puan, unlike many unlimited plans in the market, P1 will not have a quota cap; throttle the speed of users upon high usage; restrict users on any applications; or limit the time when the quota can be used. “It is the truly unlimited plan made available because P1 is celebrating our 5<sup>th</sup> birthday.” he said.</blockquote>
Is unlimited quota really worth it? I mean Unifi offers 2.5 times the speed for the same price (Rm149), why would anyone pay P1 the same price for a connection that was 2.5 times slower? Apparently P1 is offering 'unlimited' connection, i.e. no data cap, or the way the internet was made to run. Unfortunately, many telcos do throttle and slow down your connection for certain traffic.

The thing is that my Unifi connection doesn't throttle or slow down my connection, and if I use OpenDNS or Google DNS, then I bypass their censorship as well (most of it anyway). So I would certainly be hard press to recommend anyone take the P1 ForHome connection, unless Unifi wasn't an option for you. The price you pay at Rm149 for a connection speed that was less than half of a regular Unifi connection is just preposterous.
