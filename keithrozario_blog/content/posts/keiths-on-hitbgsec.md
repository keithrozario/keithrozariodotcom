I haven't blogged in a long while -- but I have a good(ish!) excuse.

I spent most of August prepping for the #HITBGSEC conference in Singapore. It was my first time presenting at a security conference, and I had an absolute blast. The output of the countless hours I spent is in the embedded youtube video below, and the presentation material can downloaded <a href="/uploads/hitb-ursula-2.key">here[.key]</a> and a <a href="https://hitbgsec.keithrozario.com">html version</a> here <em>(it's very sluggish, as it's hosted behind cloudflare + cloudfront + s3 -- and it's 100MB in size)</em>

Obviously some jokes were pretty lame, and a few puns missed their mark, but if you look past that, the underlying story was pretty well received.
