Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being....<!--more-->

Steve Jobs was 'The Man' in just about everything he did. Together with Steve Wozniak he started a company that change the face of computing not once but twice.

The first time he did it was when he started Apple computers.

The Second time was when he came back to Apple and took over a company on the verge of bankruptcy, he then turned it into the a GIANT of immense proportions, and in the process changed the way the world listened to music, altered our expectations of what a mobile phone should be like and introduced design to the masses...although some didn't realize it.

Leave aside your iPhone vs. Android rivalry and take a moment to remember this man and all his accomplishments, <a title="http://t.co/rdnjozIq" href="http://t.co/rdnjozIq">here</a>, <a title="http://t.co/choYQH7J" href="http://t.co/choYQH7J">here</a> and <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">here</a>
