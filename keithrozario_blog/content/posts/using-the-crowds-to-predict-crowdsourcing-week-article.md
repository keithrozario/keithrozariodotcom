A couple of days ago, I was invited to blog about crowdsourcing trends for a big event happening in Singapore on the 3rd to 7th of June. It's called Crowdsourcingweek and if you're interested in learning more about crowdsourcing there's a whole boat-load of interesting speakers and events going on--so I definitely encourage you to attend.

The article was about crowd-predicting and how Francis Galton first discovered how crowds could predict (quite accurately) even though the individual members of those crowds had wildly different answers.
