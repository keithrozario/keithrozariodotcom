<p>Sayakenahack was undoubtedly the highlight of my 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you've come from sayakenahack.com, I'm sorry  but  I've shutdown the site :(. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I learnt so much from it, and it was even my ticket for presenting at Hack In the Box Singapore ...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But all good things must come to an end, there's no point having a site that does nothing but consume my hosting charges on amazon. I'll still keep the domain, but over the next few days I'll redirect visitors to the site to this specific blogpost.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While sayakenahack in it's old form will never be resurrected, there hopefully is an opportunity for an official breach notification site sometime in the future -- I'll keep you in up to date.<br></p>
