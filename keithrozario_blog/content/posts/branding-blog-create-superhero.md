![](/uploads/458254192_9d4462bac5-300x199.jpg "458254192_9d4462bac5")While blogging over the weekend, I stumbled across an interesting article on <a title="Blog Persona" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2011/11/blogworld-lisa-barone-blog-persona.html" target="_blank">marketing blogs</a>. Part of the article advised on creating a blog identity, a sort of superhero that represented the blog. This would make your blog more memorable and thus help differentiate your blog in a very very crowded space. A superhero could be something quite simple, just a adjective and a noun and one of my favorite blogs, the evil HR lady springs to mind. Although I read the blog so often, I can't remember the name of the author, but the branding is persistent and it just sticks. So I thought I'd create an online persona that fit my blog and a logo to go along with it. After all, keith's blog is just as memorable as John's blog or Mark's blog, there really is nothing 'sticky' about it.<!--more-->
<h2><strong>Start with the Noun</strong></h2>
I thought it would be easier to start with the noun, first I would define the identity I wanted to project and then I would describe that with an adjective. Was I a 'geek' or a 'blogger' or a 'techie'? I got a whole list of nouns that I thought would define me. I initially thought 'blogger' would be the best, but in the end I felt it was a bit too generic, it doesn't really convey much information. A generic noun would be a waste, almost as bad as 'guy' or 'man', it doesn't define a persona just describes the obvious, and since my superhero only has 2 words I would waste 50% of the wording on something extremely obvious. (of course he's a blogger, I'm on his blog!!)

So I had to muck around a bit more, I got a few more nouns to really convey what it was I wanted to achieve on this blog, stuff like explorer and experimenter sprung to mind. However, in the end since this blog is very technology focused I chose techy. That would convey quite a lot of information regarding the blog, and create a persona at the same time.

Finally, to tidy up the noun, I was left with 2 different spellings. It was either tekkie or techy, both of which were accurate (since neither is a word but merely an entry in the <a title="Tekkie" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tekkie" target="_blank">urban dictionary</a>). I chose techy, if only so that people wouldn't confuse tekkie with trekkie (another urban dictionary entry for people who love Star Trek). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a few episodes here and there of Jean Luc Piccard blasting the borg, but really that's not what I'm going for and I would not want my brand to be associated (even by virtue of a typo) to Star Trek, I'm not that kind of geek!
<h2><strong>Work out the Adjective</strong></h2>
Next I thought it would be worth to work up a adjective to describe my work. I wanted a defining Adjective to really differentiate me from the other 'techys' out there. So I fiddled around with 'awesome' and 'awestruck' and more cheeky 'miscreant' and 'rambunctious'. Some of them were a bit too presumptuous for my taste, for instance 'The Awesome Techy' wasn't really a persona I wanted to project. <em>(although I am awesome!!, my mom would agree)</em>

Eventually I reverted back to some old ideas, like 'The Experimental Techy' or 'The imperfect Techy'. Those were personas I could really see myself projecting. In the end I was left debating with myself (at bloody midnight on a monday) on whether 'The Experimental Techy' or 'The Rogue Techy' would take the cake? I'm still deciding.

And now that I see the full words, I can of get the feeling 'The Rogue Tekkie' would sound a lot cooler than the 'The Rogue Techy' somehow replacing the C's with K's gives names a cooler more funky feeling.
<h2>Iterate if you feel like it</h2>
Then I felt like iterating through the process with adjectives and nouns helps spawn more ideas. Some of them I liked, for instance 'The Experimenting Tekkie from Malaysia' , or 'The noob-friendly tekkie' or even more interesting the 'Rogue Tekkie Extraordinare', some of them fell off the way-side.

For now though, I felt "The Rogue Blogger" would be a good start, and I could iterate further if required. Now I'm working on a tagline. My current tagline is "The web one day at a time" which sort of identifies with the feel of the blog, but really is waaay to generic to be a differentiating factor.

I think the Superhero and the tagline have to match up and once that's done, hopefully I can crowdsource a logo to go with it.

That's all for now, Rogue Blogger OUT!!
