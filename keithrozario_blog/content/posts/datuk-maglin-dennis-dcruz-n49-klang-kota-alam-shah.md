So it's official. Datuk Maglin D'Cruz will compete in N.48 Kota Alam Shah in Klang. Sadly this is true.

I never liked Datuk Maglin, he's the Deputy Information Communications and Culture Minister that was <a title="MCMC looking to ‘control’ social media at GE13: A worrying trend" href="http://www.keithrozario.com/2013/03/mcmc-looking-to-control-social-media-at-ge13-a-worrying-trend.html">looking at ways to 'control' social media</a>. I won't go much further as to why this is a bad idea--but it just goes to show how in touch Datuk Maglin is on the social media.

To put things into perspective, Datuk Maglin only <a title="Maglin D Cruz Wordpress" href="http://maglindcruz.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">setup a blog for his assault on the DUN seat yesterday</a>. You heard that right, we had a Deputy Minister of Information Communications, that only started to blog--yesterday!! That's not as worrying as the fact, that his <a title="Datuk Maglin Dennis Dcruz Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Datuk-Maglin-Dennis-Dcruz/119618234810289" target="_blank">facebook page wasn't updated since October 2011</a>.

How do you qualify to be a DEPUTY MINISTER in INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS--when you don't have  a proper blog or properly maintain your Facebook page?

Things get more strange--because Datuk Maglin appears to have 2 websites--one which is his blog for the N.49 seat (which started only yesterday), and another at mdcruz.my. I mention mdcruz.my, simply because that website is still wishing visitors happy new year--for 2012 (pic below)!! Needless to say as of today, there is no mention of Datuk Maglin competing in N.48 Kota Alam Shah on Datuk Maglins official website. The website appears to be last updated more than a year ago.

If Datuk Maglin can't even update his own bloody website and facebook page, while he was Deputy Minister of Information Communications--that doesn't really speak volumes of his ability now does it?
