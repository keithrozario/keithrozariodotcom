<h2>Random thoughts on the matter</h2>
<ol>
 	<li> We still need a single identifier in Malaysia (IC Number), this is administrative necessity. LHDN needs to check your bank accounts, Election Commission needs to know you're not double-voting..etc.</li>
 	<li>But that single identifier should <strong>not</strong> be used as an authenticator. No one should ask me for my IC number as a means of authenticating myself. When I call the bank, they shouldn't be asking me for my IC number as a means of proving my identity to them.</li>
 	<li>There's too much info in the IC number (age, state, gender). Take all of that out, and replace with a random blob of numbers -- one that cannot be guessed as well. So something like 8 numbers and 4 letters large enough, so criminals can't guess.</li>
 	<li>We need 'identity-freezes' in Malaysia. In America you can freeze your credit, but in Malaysia we need to go a step further and put an Identity freeze, especially for internet services.</li>
 	<li>Check out section 114(a) of the evidence act, wrongly registered phone numbers are a thing, and they're bad. If someone registered a pre-paid account in your name, and posted something bad -- you'd be in trouble.</li>
 	<li>If you took a loan from Maybank to buy a house, and 1 year later defaulted on the loan, no other bank in the country would grant you a loan. This protects the banks from issuing credit to someone who can't pay back. So we have credit freezes.</li>
 	<li>Let's use the same mechanism to allow people to lock their <strong>identities</strong>, so no one can open bank accounts, telco accounts, not even Astro, TNB or Indah Water as long as the identity is locked. This way, the value of a stolen identity is tremendously reduced, and we protect breached victims.</li>
 	<li>Identities can be 'un-freezed', e.g. when you buy a house, but then re-freezed shortly after.</li>
