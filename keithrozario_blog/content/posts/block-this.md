A notice posted on the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission's (MCMC) Facebook page said the decision was made to block websites that "<strong>promote</strong>, <strong>spread information</strong> and <strong>encourage people to join the Bersih 4 demonstration</strong>", on grounds that this will "threaten national stability".

I cannot then tell you to join Bersih and call for free and fair elections, and I couldn't begin to articulate that our Prime Minister has received BILLION ringgit donations from foreign sources, and certainly I must refrain from encouraging you to do your civic duty to attend tomorrows rally.

I also shouldn't post pictures like the one below:
