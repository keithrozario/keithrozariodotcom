Got Maxis Fiber to your home, but want to change your WiFi passwords, then here's how you do it.

![Image-1-Maxis-Logon](/uploads/Image-1-Maxis-Logon-820x386.png)First you need to logon to your router. You can do so by opening your Web-Browser and type http://192.168.1.254 (where you'd normally type google.com), or just click <a href="http://192.168.1.254">here</a>.

You should either see a picture like the above, then you'd need to enter the username and password, or if you haven't setup a router password, then you'd see this:<!--more-->

Step 3 is simple. Just enter a new SSID (this is your Wi-Fi name) and then a new password. Please pick one that is secure and long. Finally hit the <strong>apply</strong> button and you're good to go.

Now if you haven't setup a router username and password, you should set it up as well. To do this, hit on the Advance configuration link at the bottom of the screen.

Next select Toolbox-&gt;User Management from the left menu.

Then click Change My Password, that would allow you to change your router password.

Hope you enjoyed the post.
