I posted the tweet above about 40 minutes ago, complaining about my omni-present (or omni-absent) Unifi connection issues about an hour ago.

Barely 30 minutes later, a friend of mine retweeted it and cc'ed a TM twitter account @TMConnects<!--more-->

TM then ask for further details via a tweet below.

As of right now, I'm 8 days without an Unifi connection, 3 tickets raised, an email to tmceo@tm.com.my and a tweet to @TMconnects, I'm running out of ideas and avenues to lodge complaints to, but I've been doing my research, and once I've resolved this issue--in whatever century that may occur--I will seek compensation and will not accept a simple 'rebate', I intend to seek actual compensation for the ridiculous amount of down-time I'm experiencing. Will update soon.
