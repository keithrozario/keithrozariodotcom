<a href="http://digwp.com/">![](/uploads/shovel-icon.jpg "Digging into Wordpress")Digging into Wordpress</a> is a fantastic blog (and book) written by absolute masters of the wordpress realm. Recently they put up a <a href="http://digwp.com/2011/05/best-caching-plugin-wordpress/">poll on the best caching plugin for wordpress</a> and the results clearly show that my favorite caching plugin, Hypercache is NOT the de facto standard. In fact it comes in a distant 3rd to<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/"> w3 total cache </a>and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">wp super cache</a>. Oh well, I guess it pays to be different. However if you're a wordpress newbie and looking for some new insights into wordpress, I absolutely recommend subscribing to their blog <a href="http://digwp.com/">here.</a><!--more-->

The book can be purchased at 75USD + shipping, or you can buy a standard ebook at just USD27. It's a bit on the high side for me, so I'm refraining (or at least considering my options). I don't doubt that the book has absolutely marvelous input, but the shipping charges to Malaysia make the book cost more than 100USD, which is way too high (especially for a Malaysian).

If you're state-side, my advice would be go get it, but I haven't read it, so take that advice with a pinch of salt.
