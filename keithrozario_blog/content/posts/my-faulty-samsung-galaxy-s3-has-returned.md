![](/uploads/rsz_samsung-galaxy-s3-back-cover_1.jpg "rsz_samsung-galaxy-s3-back-cover_1")Before my recent trip to Australia, my brand new Samsung Galaxy S3 failed on me. The speaker just went *kaput*.

Well not really *kaput*, but there was absolutely no sound coming out of it. Needless to say I was a bit frustrated, annoyed and just downright disappointed. This was an expensive top of the line phone, and it's speakers shouldn't be failing after barely 4 months.

So I called up Maxis and reported my predicament, and Maxis said I had two options, either send it back to them or send it directly to Samsung. I figured I might as well cut out the middleman and send the phone directly to Samsung.

So after a few calls and some planning, I found out that Samsung normal fix rate was <strong>3 working days</strong>. Which wasn't good enough for me as I had to fly off by the next day (shit happens), so I survived in Australia with a faulty phone whose alarm wasn't working. Fortunately, my wife's Iphone which I bought for her 2 years ago was still working perfectly.

After arriving back to Malaysia I went straight to the Samsung Service center in Digital Mall USJ (first floor) on a Saturday. The told me I'd be able to collect the phone within 3 working days, which worked out to Wednesday.

However, I got a call the following Tuesday afternoon informing me the phone was repaired and I could collect it directly from the service center. So I headed there I collected my now-working phone. So now my Galaxy S3 is working perfectly again.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
While I wasn't happy that my S3 was spoilt, I guess these things happen. What I was impressed with was the speed at which Samsung fixed the issue. I believe that if you have a Samsung phone and you head directly to the service center, you'll have a better response rate then sending it back to Maxis.

On the part of Maxis, they also helped me register the IMEI, so even though I didn't have the warranty card or receipt or purchase, Samsung was more than happy to fix the phone since the IMEI was already registered for warranty :).

Also, the service center was nearly empty, so I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be served. That to me is good service.

Samsung has been getting a lot of flak recently, not only have the lost the court fight against Apple--<a title="Samsung Strands bloggers in Germany" href="http://asia.cnet.com/should-samsung-have-stranded-a-blogger-at-ifa-update-62218570.htm" target="_blank">they recently tried to strand 2 Indian bloggers in Germany</a>. However, in Malaysia, I give them a whooping two thumbs up for service!!

Maxis--whom I've chastised on this blog a couple of times--also receive two thumbs up for registering the phone for me, and directing me to Samsung instead of insisting I go back to Maxis.
<h2>Iphone Repair KL</h2>
A year ago I dropped my wife's Iphone on a rough concrete surface and the screen completely cracked. I remember calling up Maxis and being given a timeline of weeks to fix the phone. On that instance I headed over to a 3rd party <a title="Iphone repair in the Klang Valley" href="http://iphonerepairkl.com" target="_blank">iphonerepairkl.com</a>, those guys fixed it on the spot for RM500. It was a painful experience, but I was thoroughly impressed with the guys there, they fixed the phone in front of you, and they were extremely professional about it. If you can't wait the weeks it takes to fix an iPhone--and are willing to shell out some cash for the repair--head on over to them.

I wonder if Samsung has anything similar, given that Samsung phones now outsell iPhones?

By the way, remember the two bloggers Samsung stranded in Germany--they eventually found someone to sponsor their trip back home--Nokia (ouch!)
