![](/uploads/4891474513_0954283168_m-150x150.jpg "Test Media RSS")MediaRSS is a wordpress plugin that allows you to post images into your RSS stream. So instead of seeing, just plain text in GoogleReader or FriendFeed you'd see text and a nice little photo. The plugin supposedly uses the first image in your post as the thumbnail to the RSS fee.

This is just a TEST!! Stay tuned for more. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
