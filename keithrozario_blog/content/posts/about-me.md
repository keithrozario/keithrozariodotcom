Hey there, if you're hoping to reach Keith you've come to the right place.

The best way to reach me is via email keith[at]keithrozario.com (replace the [at] with @).

I do not accept 'sponsored post' or any other external marketing material to be posted on the site. Please don't send me these.

If you're really paranoid, here's my <a title="PGP Public Key" href="https://www.keithRozario.com/wp-content/special-uploads/keithRozario.asc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PGP key</a> if you wish to send me an encrypted email. All e-mail should be sent to keith[at]keithRozario.com.

I must warn you that I rarely use my PGP key, so responses will take time -- quite some time!
