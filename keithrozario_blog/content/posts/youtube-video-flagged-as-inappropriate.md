Last week one of my most popular videos detailing how I hacked Unifi accounts was 'flagged' as inappropriate in YouTube--apparently it was in violation of their community guidelines.

As such my video was made unavailable and essentially deleted from Youtube.

I was upset.

The email I received from YouTube, gave no indication as to what I did wrong, and even though it states that someone have viewed my video, the language used suggest this was just an automated message sent to my inbox. Nowhere does it suggest an actual human viewed my video and made a judgement, and even worse no justification was given for the removal of the video other than it was 'flagged'.

Now the video is one of my favorites, and garnered more than 15,000 views before it was taken offline. Youtube allows 'hacking' content on their site, as the multiple DefCon and ScmooCon videos can attest to. So the only message I got was that the video was 'misleading' and considered spam.

I made no intention to mis-lead anyone. The video clearly demonstrates how anyone can hack into a Unifi router using Shodan, and from there actually obtain WiFi passwords as well as the Unifi passwords. So I didn't quite understand why I was being punished when the video demonstrated exactly what the title suggest.

In any case, Youtube allowed for a appeal, which I made, and once again I received an automated reply that didn't provide any useful information.

Haih.

I have no power over Youtube, and nowhere to plead my case. In fact there were more likes for the video than dislikes, and my intentions were sincere and I have no idea what they considered 'inappropriate and misleading', and the whole experience has left me disappointed and upset with Youtube.

However, Youtube may be the biggest player on the block, but certainly not the only player, and I've moved the video to Vimeo instead. Here's the video embedded below, if you think if was mis-leading or not, please let me know. I've got nothing to work with from Google.
