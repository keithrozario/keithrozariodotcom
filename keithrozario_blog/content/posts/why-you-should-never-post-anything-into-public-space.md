![](/uploads/privacy.jpg "privacy")A lot of people seem to think that you can get away with loading files into public space and that no one will see them until I send someone a link.

That's WRONG!!<!--more-->

A couple of months ago, I pasted a Jpeg version of my resume on picasaweb.google.com and thought no one is going to see it until I send someone the link. My thinking was that there were millions (or billions) of pictures on Picasa and no one is going to be interested in my resume. More precisely, I couldn't set permissions up because that would mean anyone wishing to view the resume would then have to register for a picasa account and have the right access rights before they accessed it.

I was wrong!

Check out this website called <a title="Pipl" href="http://www.pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl.com</a> . It's really cool. You type in a first name and last name and it then searches through various social networks to locate people who fit the bill. For instance, I typed my name and the results were astounding:
<p style="text-align: center;">![](/uploads/pipl_keith_rozario.jpg "Pipl_results_keith_rozario")</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were at least 4 different Keith Rozarios, one of them even shared the same intials as me, KJR. Further scrolling down, I found that there was an actor named Keith Rozario who acted in a movie called marauders back in 1986 (this information was pulled from imdb). This was so cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sorry guys, I booked<em> <a title="Keith Rozario" href="http://www.keithrozario.com" target="_blank">http://keithrozario.com</a></em> first :). Another Prime example on why you should book your domain right now before someone else takes it and starts sullying your good name.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what really blew me away was this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">![](/uploads/Picasa_photo.jpg "Picasa_Resume")</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was a link to my resume on picasa. Here for anyone to download. Interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just goes to show that whatever you post onto public space will be viewed by someone. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security through obscurity</a> doesn't work. You should protect your secure images/files online via password protection and share those passwords only with those that you wish to share those images/files with. The net is full of psychos and sharing personal data online is not a good choice...trust me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On a lighter note, <a title="pipl" href="http://www.pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl</a> really is cool as it does a full blown search for networks like facebook, linkedin and even friendster all from one interface. The website design could use a touchup but the concept is really cool. Try it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Adios for now!!</p>
