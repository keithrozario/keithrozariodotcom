  "content": "i'm in the market for a new router for my home..i'm interested in a router that has a good firewall capability..not like the usual off the shelf like asus, dlink n stuff...i have a Palo Alto Networks PA-200 given by my company but the thing here, it doesn't have a built in wifi..although i can easily hook up an AP to it but i tried to minimize the devices turned on. The option that i have at the moment is mikrotik but wondering if there's any other alternative?"
