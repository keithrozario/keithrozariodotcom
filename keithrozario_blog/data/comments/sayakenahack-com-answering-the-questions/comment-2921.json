  "content": "Thanks for all your effort, it's very much appreciated by those who are intelligent enough to understand.  Those who are too stupid to read and understand but just follow and then condemn after hearing bits and pieces should just bugger away. \nMost of us who read your explanation are aware that our data has already been leaked.  Now we just want to know what has been leaked and by whom.  I'd like to know which banks had my data breached and what type of data so I can take precaution too.  But sadly looking at how letting us know the telco data breach has already given you so much trouble I doubt you or anyone else will attempt it. \nAnyway, do know that your efforts are really appreciated.  A BIG THANK YOU."
