I praise for your efforts towards better internet, transparency and public awareness.\n\nDespite the leak, it really is a shame on how we handle even the most basic security measures and it almost like we don't even have any single of respects for public data &amp; information. I lodged complaints in the past to MCMC. Websites like TMNET, pizzahuts and some others used to handle password as plain text, it annoys me a lot. Recently, I stumble upon a dating service which expose pretty much everything to the internet (including MySQL port!). I drop a message to the admin, but they don't give a damn. A leak for a dating website could be quite disastrous. \n\nAs far as I can see, a security leak in a software system may lead to a leak on the management or people level. I think if we investigate the vendors for certain websites, we might get a hint or two."
