  "content": "Lowyat is just another tech journalism website. They have no technical skills whatsoever and I bet they barely understood what you just mentioned up there.\n\nI'm with you on that. And before I verified my own IC on your website, I did some research on the source (you), and if you were so bold to do this with your Identity, aside from querying some of your servers , I already had some trust on the query website.\n\nAnother person can set up a similar site quickly with more sinister intents.\n\nCome on, time to wake up to the 21st century. Our govt have to get with it. I'm not at all surprised by this leak and the lack of care of our data of various agencies and companies in Malaysia. It's just a matter of time."
