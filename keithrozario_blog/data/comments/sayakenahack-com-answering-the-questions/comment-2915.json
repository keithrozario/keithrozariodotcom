  "content": "I am quite dumbfounded by the actions of the Malaysian governing bodies. Sometimes I think Malaysia will never prosper with mentality that is still in the 3rd world. What you did Keith is remarkable, I checked a few of my family members IC and well, you don't need to know the rest of the story.
