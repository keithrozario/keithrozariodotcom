  "content": "Hi Keith - need your advise.My current unifi router is RG TMRND Gen1.0.\nMy problem is I cannot view the cctv image on my smartphone or laptop at home using the unifi wifi.But able to view on my hp at home using 3G data(usage is very high).\nMy sister overseas can view the cctv image on her smartphone using her wifi.\nMy cctv supplier said the problem is due to the unifi router and said to change router to d-link DIR615.But when I called TM Unifi, they said they do not have any more of the DIR 615.\n\nCan I buy the d-link DIR 615 from outside retailer? Is it the same and will this solve the problem?\nThanks."
