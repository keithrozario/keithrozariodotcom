  "content": "Hi keithrozario,\n\nI've bought a unit of RT-N12HP after read some reviews and completed QIS setup, and all my phones in the house can connected to it and even HYPP TV can run properly. But then there is an issue that my laptop can't connected even my adapter can detect the wireless network.\n\nI'd been scratching my head and tried many solutions but still it doesn't work. It would be very much appreciate if you share your view on these issue. Thanks "
