  "content": "Hey I have the exact same problem with your 1 year old Asus router, but mine was TP-Link WR841HP. This TP-Link router of mine only last a week, and its WiFi start failing although the wired-Ethernet connections were fine. The connection speed for WiFi peak at 0.03Mbps, although my internet speed supposed to be 30Mbps. Sometime it just can't connect at all. So I send back to the place i bought the router and they check for me, surprisingly it was fine when they tested it. Then i thought that its my own problem, so i went back home and try again, still the same problem. But when I use back the router from UniFi its perfectly alright. Do you know what's the problem here?"
