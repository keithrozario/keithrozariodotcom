It was to do with my connection settings.\n\n\nTry the following: Go to the wireless connection on your laptop, then select properties-&gt;Internet Protocol Version 4-&gt;Properties...\n\n\nAnd set the 'Obtain IP Address automatically'. If you had a static address there it may not connect to your new router with the new settings.\n\n\nLet me know if that helps.\n\n\nKeith"
