  "content": "I'm sorry but I cannot take what you've written seriously, half the things you say are either different of the opposite from what the crash course video you posted says. Beside that you could make a case for almost any ancient world conqueror as being in relation to to ISIS. Besides that where our your other sources, are you credible,and were you unbiased? Further more I know middle schools level kids that are better writers then you, and they know it (really the number  of mistakes is sort of embarrassing). Also I don't no that much about ISIS but the Mongols are sort of like that phrase in like a lion and out like a lamb, as far as their imperialism goes, they were pretty good. They often took over without violence, they promoted religious diversity, after Genghis Khan went on his rapes and set his examples he would not abandon and neglect his captured lands like the British imperialism of Africa. Nope, he protected and promoted the poorer regions, he took care of problems that are plaguing America, like the differences between the rich and poor. also he did help move science and culture around, aiding in seeding Eurasia with all sorts of possibilities. I'm just saying as far as it goes, the Mongols were significantly intelligent and protective, with tolerance towards diversity and religion as well as a strong sense of pride and family as they lost many of their lands and conquest do to returning home to mourn their losses. As for the record Genghis Khan is sort of a progressive kick-start for the world while ISIS's rebuilding of Syria and Iraq seem to be a intolerant push backwards. In the end if ISIS conquers the planet, I'd hate to be you."
