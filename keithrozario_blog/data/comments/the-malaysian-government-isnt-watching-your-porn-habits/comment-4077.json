  "content": "I'm sorry, did you just revealed that there is a whole department of people watching child porns all day to catch those people who watch child porn?\n\nFirst they search up child porn, watch them, download it, digital signature it, create their child porn videos storage and list and arrest those who share and watch it. Search up websites which host child porn to 'monitor' the contents. Actively search up child porn all days to 'update' their list, and again, arrest those people who watch it.\n\nAre these not pedophiles masquerading as 'child porn officers' ? So they get away because it is their job, officers who 'monitor contents. Even if they arent true pedophiles, they would be conditioned into as a result of hours of watching child porn would change their brain circuit wiring. \n\nFrom my technical background, few in society is true pedophile, many are broken people who want to achieve a sense of greatness by defying authority, conditioned into being one or those who loathe and want to revenge the society. Fix the society and broken world we live in and all will improve."
