I'm sure the guys at Google and Facebook could easily produce a FinSpy equivalent if they wanted too. Just because our government 'can' do it, and some other governments 'are' doing it, doesn't mean that our government is doing it.\n\n\nThe article title says 'Malaysia' but the content of the article clearly allude to the government..., it even points to Putrajaya and starts drawing conclusions based on other governments.  So technically you're right, but if you really believe the word Malaysia in the title doesn't refer to the government...then what does it refer to?"
