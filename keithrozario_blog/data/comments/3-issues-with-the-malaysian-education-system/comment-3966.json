I appreciate comments whenever I get them, and try my best to reply to all of them.\n\nI understand that a lot of teachers are struggling with the flip-flopping of the education Ministry, what's even worse is that we KNOW that most Malaysian students don't fully comprehend the English language, trying to force them to learn Science and Maths in English would be a mountain to tall to climb."
