  "content": "From this article,it really open up my mind to think out of the box of what should be done to improve our education system.The issue that I like the most is regarding on the PPSMI issue that really hot until now.Our education system keep changing from Malay then English.Then change back to Malay for teaching science and mathematics.This process of changing is simple for the government's autority but then,just think of the suffer of students and the teachers itself.They need time to adapt and get comfortable with the changing.I experience this suffer since i studied sn n mt in English during my secondary school.Then,now i am studying Education in Biology also in English.Then,when i become a teacher,i must teach students in Malay.Everyone knows Biology have many terms.Therefore,it takes time to learn Malay term because I have been taught in English term.To translate it it quite awkward for us and not too comfortable to teach.Its not saying that i am clever enough in English.Not.But then it already become normal for us.If we future teacher have suffered this,just think on the students itself.I do agree on the idea of \"why don't we strive to make it easier for them, by teaching English in English classrooms, and science in science classrooms&#8211;in the language of their choice.\" \" Why can't we just let children learn in the language their most comfortable with, and armed with a love and appreciation for science, they'll be able to overcome the language barrier as and when they reach it \".This is because students will be more enjoy learning in their favorable condition."
