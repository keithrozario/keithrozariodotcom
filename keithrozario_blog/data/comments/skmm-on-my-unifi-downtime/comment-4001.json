  "content": "Well, that's not what I meant, the law itself is pretty decent in it's specificity, but where it falls short is not stipulating the consequences of not meeting the minimum requirements of service, which is very frustrating especially when you're on the receiving end of a 9 day downtime, you expect to be compensated for much more than just the 9 day payments.\n\nI understand where you're coming from though."
