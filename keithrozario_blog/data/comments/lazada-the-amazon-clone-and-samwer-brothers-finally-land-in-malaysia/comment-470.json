They claim the item returned was opened and that the item was returned after 14 days. However, I am aware of their terms and did not open the box I only opened the courier packaging in order to remove the Return slip and I did return the item within 14 days. I have the  courier receipts to prove it. Their customer service refused to listen to my explanation. and I am now force to take the item back without any recourse.\n "
