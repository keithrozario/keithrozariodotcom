  "content": "Lazada is launched in Southeast Asian countries. Samwer brothers are going to cover most countries where Amazon is not present in competition. They also launched other Amazon clone with regional language i.e. Linio and Jumia. Lazada provides cash on delivery but it takes too much days. While local ecommerce websites provide COD very fast."
