  "content": "My case is a lot more saddening. I have purchased ESET antivirus from them for RM120. It has now been 1 month, and they refuse to refund my money. Literally, everytime I ask for a refund they sidetrack and say they are close to getting the item. This really puts a taint on my trust with online shopping in Malaysia now. I dare not try any new service, until customers have brought forth their experiences. In Lazada's case, I'm not the only one who has been robbed of his money."
