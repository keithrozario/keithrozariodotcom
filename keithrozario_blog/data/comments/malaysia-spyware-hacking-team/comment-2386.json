  "content": "Thanks for the question, it's a good one.\n\nHacking Team's company policy (which can be found in archive form online) state:\n\"We provide our software only to governments or government agencies. We do not sell products to individuals or private businesses.\"\n\nAlso within the e-mail trails, and in the Hacking Team invoices, specific Government agencies are named. Hacking Team do a due diligence on their customers to ensure that they're valid Government agencies as required by law.\n\nUnder the Wassenaar agreement, the tools that Hacking Team sells are considered 'weapons' and as such if a Malaysian company has bought these 'weapons' but not for the Malaysian government, then there is a strong public interest to find out who exactly procured them and for what reason.\n\nKeith"
