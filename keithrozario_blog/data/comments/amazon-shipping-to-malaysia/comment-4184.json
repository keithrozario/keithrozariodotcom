  "content": "I bought a pair of shoes from Amazon US but the problem was that seller weren't shipping to my country which is UAE and i really got upset. so the solution was only freight forwarder and these forwarders were charging too much which was unbearable, and i talk to my friend and he recommend me a third party forwarder and i contacted them, they were professional very kind.\n\nso whenever i bought something online i use services of few freight forwarders companies. and these are ship7, and shippingclear."
