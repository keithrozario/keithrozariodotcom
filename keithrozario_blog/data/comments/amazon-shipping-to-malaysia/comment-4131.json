  "content": "Thank You for sharing your thoughts. It is good to know that it is kind of a You live, and You learn the process to all of us. Those possible Boxing day sales are something to follow; thank You for pointing them. International shipping to Malaysia can be easy and cheapest. But the Freight forwarders charge at higher prices, but when it comes to the third-party package forwarding company, you can save up to 80% off on your shipment that quite remarkable. I would suggest you check these freight forwarding companies like MyUS, Global Shopaholics, etc. My experience with MyUS isn’t bad, but I like the way Global Shopaholics treat me; they provide me with a free US address for up to 180 days with free storage."
