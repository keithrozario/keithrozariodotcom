  "content": "Hi Keith, I bought a microphone from Amazon and had it shipped to a US address of a relative to bring back to Malaysia. The mic however was defective when got it &amp; returned when my relative got back to the US after the 30 days return period. Still got a full refund. The best thing about Amazon is that you can test things before you accept them. SLR's, lenses, audio gear etc as long as you return them within the allowed period. Here is Malaysia, sorry no go. Electronic stuff are cheaper through Amazon too if they are towards the end of life cycle compared to here.\n\nBought some ebooks too. Works without a Kindle. I did a short write up on my site http://jameswoo.net/free-or-cheap-ebooks-in-malaysia/ in case others are interested."
