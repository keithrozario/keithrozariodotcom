  "content": "I'm using proxy warehouse, Hopshopgo. But the shipping cost is the same, because both using DHL. Advantage Hopshopgo only they offer repackage.\n\nThat my story. I have Armenian friend here and awesome income also. He bought complete set of AV set with floorstading KEF speaker from Amazon. Unfortunately, 1 of surround speaker faulty &amp; he request replacement but Amazon CS replied warranty not cover outside US. He pissed &amp; state the review very bad on comment section. The next day, One guy from Amazon (claimed as Manager) called to offer repairing fee in Malaysia or courrier the internal component of speaker (DIY yourself). He choose #2 and the component received a week after. \n\nThis story conclude Amazon not only shipped here, but also Support &amp; Warranty. "
