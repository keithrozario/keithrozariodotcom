  "content": "I used a singapore/malaysia based forwarding company uclick2buy.com who offer US address for parcel quality inspection and consolidation before shipment to Malaysia. Very efficient and no hassle on customs. I used another company who deliver product (Lego EV3) from China, got stucked in customs. Have to go personally and paid the tax duty before collecting. quite a chores!\n\nThe rate from uclick2buy is also cheapest in town. At least when I compared almost 10 similar such companies.\n\nFor shipment to Malaysia and Singapore from US, you should give it a try."
