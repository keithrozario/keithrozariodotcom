  "content": "Hey Jack, yeap it has to be screwed in, but you can either:\n1) Force Screw it using brute force; or\n2) Create a grove first and then screw it in\n\nI recommend (2). You should use something like the red tool, next to the yellow screwdriver in the 2nd last picture of this post.\n\nAs for the \"T\" shape, I just used it cause I had additional lack shelves. My workmanship isn't so good either, so I used them to cover up some 'untidy' work as well, and they do provide a solid platform.\n\nOverall, unless you're familiar with carpentry work, I'd recommend the \"T\" shape as well.\n\n"
