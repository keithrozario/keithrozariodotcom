How did you secure the brackets into the shelving unit if not with screws?Also—in the photo, it looks like you used 2 more 26cm lack shelves and secured them in a “T” shape, perpendicular to the other 26cm lack shelves on each side. (Here’s the part I’m talking about: http://cl.ly/H4B3). Can you give a little more info about that part?"
