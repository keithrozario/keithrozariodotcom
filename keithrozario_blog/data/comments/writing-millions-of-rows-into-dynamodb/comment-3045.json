  "content": "Yes it takes some time, and depends on a few things -- mainly how many WriteCapacityUnits you've allocated on the table. If the WriteCapacityUnits is low, you're unlikely to be able to write them all before the lambda times-out.\n\nAWS recently announced an on-demand DynamoDB which charges per write, and you can write 1 million rows for ~1 dollar. I'd use that instead, and it'd free you up from worrying about WCUs and RCUs setup."
