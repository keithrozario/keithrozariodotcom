  "content": "Hi Keith, I need to write around 250K rows in dynamodb table using node lambda, currently when I insert 15K records, when I query the table it returns some of the record i.e, 200 rows which keep increasing for some time and then stop at certain numbers around 1k -2K records. Is it expected to take time updating the records? How long it will take to show all my records? Can I configure it to happen fast?"
