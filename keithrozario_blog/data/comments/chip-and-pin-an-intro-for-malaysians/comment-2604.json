  "content": "There could be possibly a few banks in Malaysia that have already issued 'true' Chip & PIN cards, although you won't be prompted for a PIN unless it is a Chip & PIN terminal as well. So both you and the Merchant need to be upgraded before you will be asked for a PIN.\n\nThat being said, until 01-Jan-2017, you should be given the option of PIN bypass, which is to bypass the PIN request in the interim period between now and 01-Jan-2017. Post 2017, PIN bypass will still be visible, but should be declined by the issuers.\n\nI'm up for a beer anytime man :)"
