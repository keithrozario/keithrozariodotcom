  "content": "Hi Keith, \n\nThank you for this article, it's the only one I could find on this topic. I'm currently in Europe for work and suffering from the half-assed migration to Chip and PIN credit cards by HSBC Bank Malaysia. They provided their customers with the new PIN enabled cards recently but will only enforce and send out PIN numbers in August 2016. Until then they assured us that we will still be able to use our credit cards as usual and authorize using signature.\n\nThere is no issue using the new cards in Malaysia as I believe the terminals that Merchants are using support Chip and Signature so we still authorize the transaction by signing. However here in Europe all the terminals support Chip and PIN. So when using the new cards here I am prompted every single time for a PIN and when I tell the merchant I don't have one, we hit a dead end as they are clueless on how to do a PIN bypass. Being just as clueless myself on the mysteries of a handheld card terminal, we hit an impasse and I am forced to pay cash or get a local colleague to pay with their credit card.\n\nI called HSBC Bank, but they were completely useless when pressed to give me detailed instructions to advise these Merchants on how to work the PIN bypass 'workaround'. They only told me they will put in a request to send me my PIN activation code for my cards in 7 - 14 working days. Fat lot of good that will do me while I'm here!\n\nSo yes I am moaning, but I am writing to you here on the off chance you might know what HSBC was unable to tell me; what are the steps the Merchant needs to perform on a Chip and PIN terminal in order for them to accept payment from my Chip and PIN credit card but authorized with my signature instead of my non-existent PIN?\n\nThank you Keith.\n\nJaclyn"
