  "content": "I'm thinking of buying an iphone or Ipad cause I want to play Plant vs Zombies 2 (it's a childish reason, I know but I just can't help it...) but now that I read this article, I have come to my senses. Until I'm thoroughly satisfied with a new phone/tablet and the supported technology, I'm sticking with the one I'm very comfortable with even now, my N900 (it's old I know) but it's still the best qwerty phones available out there. And a qwerty keyboard is still the best and most practical way of input for writing on a mobile. Say Samsung or Sony, could you make just one model of qwerty phones with the latest android and specs? Me and a million business consumers would appreciate it very much. Thank you."
