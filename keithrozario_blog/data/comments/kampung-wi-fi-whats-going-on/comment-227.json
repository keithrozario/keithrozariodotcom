Deputy Information, Communications and Culture Minister Joseph Salang said various efforts were being taken by the ministry and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to encourage the people to opt for broadband. “Among the steps taken include organising Human Capital Development, ICT and broadband training and promotion programmes to increase the people’s awareness on the facility,” he said when replying to a question from Wong Ho Leng (DAP-Sibu).   Salang said for Sabah, a high speed broadband project providing Internet speeds of up to 10 Mbps had already been implemented in Menggatal and was expected to be fully completed by the third quarter of this year. Similar projects would be implemented in Kota Kinabalu, Penampang, Inanam, Tawau, Lahad Datu, Labuan and Elopura, he said. On Wi-Fi villages, he said, till March 1, 1,938 locations had the facility which involved a cost of RM115 million.\n\nFrom the above, per location implementation cost is approx RM60K. The question is why the cost is so high per location, how many concurrent users each location is capable of supporting and how many of these locations are functioning and serving its objective ? As usual, these information is not available for public consumption or interested party to gauge the success of this particular program vis a vis the government funded cost. Just to note, broadband penetration rate is private telco companies commercial efforts.   \n"
