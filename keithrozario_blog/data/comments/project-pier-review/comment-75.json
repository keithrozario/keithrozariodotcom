You can also subscribe to a Teambox which is pretty effective as well. \n\nThere's also a whole load of GoogleApps I just discovered that would fit the bill. \n\nThat being said not one single 'free' project management suite met my needs of :\n1) Sharing without registering\n2) Gannt Chart and dependency planning\n\nI'm still searching for that elusive suite, if you know of any please feel free to recommend them either here via any of my contact points (email/facebook/linkedin/twitter), and I'll have a look.
