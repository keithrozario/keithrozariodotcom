  "content": "I really doubt TM perform firmware updates over the web. It's not advisable under any circumstance. \n\n\nThe analogy is that you buy a house from a developer, and the developer grants you a warranty period of defects. However, do you give the developer a key to your house, so he can come in any time he pleases--or do you keep the key and tell the developer only to come around when you're at home to supervise him.\n\n\nIn making their support processes easier, TM have also reduced the security of their users on the internet. Not a good choice."
