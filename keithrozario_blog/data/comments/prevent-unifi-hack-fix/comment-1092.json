  "content": "Its as ipedo says, most of the consumers that subscribe to an isp do not know how to access the router page. Due to that reason, remote access is left on, as TM (Level 2 and above) will be able to check out your router page to check the settings. It is much more time/cost effective then sending a technician. \n\n@kar2on:disqus \n\nFeeling very frustrated after viewing your video \"http://www.keithrozario.com/2014/01/hack-unifi-in-5-minutes.html\". This is old news. Like 30th May 2010 old. Old until the site dead liao (http://archive.is/6kT9D). People already complained/gave feedback to TM back then and if fell on deaf ears. Why? It is part and parcel TM's troubleshooting workflow."
