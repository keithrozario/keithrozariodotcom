  "content": "I have said many times in other places and to people, a VPN doesnt give you anonymity rather it is a proxy that does and what you want is an encrypted tunnel to a proxy and not a VPN provider. Using a VPN provider is just like using another ISP through your existing ISP.\n\nA VPN is to connect things on the same network such as if you want to access your media or file server away from home or to access your work place network."
