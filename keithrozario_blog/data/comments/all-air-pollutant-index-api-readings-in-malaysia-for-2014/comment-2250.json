  "content": "Fundamentally, the difference is significant as the WHO has for many years now concluded that while PM10 must still be included in any developed world standard AQI formulation, it's the abundance of PM2.5 particles (those measured from 0.3 microns in size up to 2.5 microns in size) are very dangerous to our health.  This standard has been in place for almost 10 years now.\n\nEven China went on the PM2.5 standard in 2011-12 under strict pressure from the people to report the REAL and UNSAFE conditions everyday in China.  China reluctantly implemented the standard in which shows almost everyday as UNHEALTHY or SERIOUSLY UNHEALTHY.\n\nHong Kong followed in 2013 and Singapore 2014 while Malaysia still reports PM10 only,  PM10 particles do not get ingested into the body at any rate near PM2.5 particles as the mucus membrane does a simple job of keeping out 1.0 micron or larger particles however the dangerous particles such as SMOKE, HAZE, Formaldehyde, Virus, Bacteria, Mould, Outgassing such as VOC's and Chemicals all fall within the PM2.5 range.  \n\nA school or business or government office closes down in Singapore while the similar in Malaysia (in Johor) stays open with the same dangerous air pollution.  This is the challenge living in Malaysia and not moving to the current standard after 10 years."
