  "content": "Keith, that's a good suggestion for children after all, good programmers can make decent money &amp; increase productivity. I doubt the education (here or elsewhere) is really designed to teach people to think. Check out Seth Godin's book titled \"stop stealing dreams\". Think it is a good read for parents &amp; all alike. It's a free pdf, just search for it.\n\nAbout hacking, I think older people would have no interest unless they got hacked, identity stolen etc. So education campaigns may be a better way to create awareness."
