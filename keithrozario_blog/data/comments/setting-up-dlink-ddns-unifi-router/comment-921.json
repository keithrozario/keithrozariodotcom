  "content": "2 thumbs up on the lesson! I've owned my Dlink Dir-615 for a couple of years now &amp; used it only for my home network (feebly I might add). Well, I'm a Linux guy through and through and having said that... 2 of my PC are running Backtrack and I'm always doing something \"new\" per-say... Funny thing... It never dawned on me till about a week ago why I haven't invested anytime in this \"little gem\" of a router... I just wanted to say thank you for reminding me that I've over looked the thing for too long. I've actually pulled it off the cable modem and its my new network lab router for the time being. What can I say, it really is a great router and really does offer alot. Sorry for the book. I'm actually just really stoked that I'm getting to use it for more. Very great tutorial, very well spoken. I thank you sir."
