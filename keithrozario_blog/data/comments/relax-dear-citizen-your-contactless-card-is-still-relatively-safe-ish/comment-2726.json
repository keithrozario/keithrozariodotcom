  "content": "Yup. Contactless transactions are suppose to be 'frictionless' so no verification is required.\n\nBut remember in order for fraudsters to do this, they need a legitimate terminal, and that requires a bank account etc etc. So it's actually very hard to acquire anonymously, and usually leaves a long paper trail. In the end, it's unlikely to happen because the fraud leaves such a large paper trail, and usually results with the fraudster going to jail. \n\nIn order to fly under the radar, fraudsters can at most use this for 1% of their transactions--which isn't a lot, considering that contactless transactions are also of lower value."
