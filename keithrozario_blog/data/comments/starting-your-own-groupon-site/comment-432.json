  "content": "I think, staring a new deal site is not very good idea because of two main reasons:\n\n\n1 - As you mentioned there are many deal sites already in the market and going to the market and standing out of this crowd needs a very good marketing and needs resources. \n\n\n2 - Anther main point which you have mentioned is if the deals are really deal or just showing fake numbers to consumers to convince them to buy the deal!!?  I believe in long term people will come to this conclusion that most of the regular prices are fake and in fact they will get what they paid for. (To my experience except one deal, after using these deals for two years now, I got what I paid for and nothing more) so now I am thinking if this is the case why should do this!? I believe people eventually come to this conclusion, but always would be customers which buy these deals. but the market would not be like this anymore and imagine there are many deal sites competing yet."
