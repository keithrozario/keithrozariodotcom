  "content": "I'm reading this in 2018. Unifi is still garbage. Though I'm not using it for work, I need a strong connection for playing online pc games. Sometimes the Internet would die for two to three hours once every 3 days. I called TM several times whether or not everyone is facing the same problem as me but they say that its a usual thing for the Internet to go down at least once a few days. I pay rm150 every fucking month and I don't feel it is worth the price. I registered for 4mbps but when I download things, the load only shows the net is running 900 kbps at max. I mean where are the other 3mb?\nTruly, I agrees with you Keith. \nUnifi sucks. \nTM too."
