  "content": "I have the same experience recently. I have a feel that they keep issuing new report number to you to avoid you ask for rebate. The reason is they only give rebate for faulty more than 24 hours. By keep issuing you new ticket and close the new one, you will never able to have a 24-hours report. \n\n\n\nMy experience even worst. The techincian came and notice that the moderm has problem and they changed it but he din't put note in the report. the Technician recorded that was 'Customer Problem' instead of their equipment issue. Obviously the moderm was changed by TM UNIFI denied it. So I can't asked for rebate. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, TM UNIFI will never admit their mistake. The billing department will tell you to wait until the report closed and \"depend on how the report is noted\", which means just depend on whether they are 'happy' to give you rebate on their faulty or not. \n\n\n\nDon't waste your money to call 1300881221 to ask for rebate, this is a stupid HELP Line number that will cost you money in queuing for the customer representative to respond. Anyway, they wont give you anything at the end. This is the first chargeable helpline number from tele-company that I ever heard. TM memang 'Boleh'."
