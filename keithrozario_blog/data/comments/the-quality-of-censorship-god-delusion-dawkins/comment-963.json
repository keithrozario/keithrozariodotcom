  "content": "I was shocked to find the God Delusion sitting on the shelves at MPH and a few other book-stores. I was actually about to order a copy online when I saw it. \n\nAs you mentioned (and I think this is an important point), the book is always in the \"religion\" section, right next to books about strengthening your faith and why you need God in your life. It seems to me that whatever censorship happens in Malaysia only happens at face value. If the word \"Allah\" is in the title, then a red flag goes up, but a book entitled \"The God Delusion\" is just fine.\nI don't think the people responsible for the censorship of books here in Malaysia actually read what the books are about. I'm confident that if presented with the cover page of the \"The God Delusion\" book, they would pass it on just fine. They wouldn't bother turning the book over and taking a glance at the summary.\nThere are a few other god-related controversial books that seem to have passed the radar, but those end up in the Science or other sections. The God Delusion has always been and will remain in the religion section, for some reason.\nIn a way, that is a good thing. First, it shows how ridiculous the censorship bureau really is. Second, it lets people read more books! Books that their own government would normally be afraid of letting them touch.\nGuess what? The God Delusion book is often sold out (and then restocked) at the book stores. I find that heart-warming. Human curiosity beats everything else.\nHappy reading, everyone :)"
