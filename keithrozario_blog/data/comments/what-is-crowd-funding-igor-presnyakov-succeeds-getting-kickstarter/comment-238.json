  "content": "Igor is fantastic! Do you have musical scores of nice songs such as these, i.e. meant to be played the classical guitar way? I have only played one such song before, many years ago - Right Here Waiting from Richard Marx (so you know how long). Watching the video of Igor makes me want to play classical guitar."
