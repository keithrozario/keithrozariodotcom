That's not just understandable but expected to some degree.\n\nMy issue is with saying that it has entered the bloodstream and somehow \nthe bloodstream must be 'cleaned'. That's just not an accurate thing to \nsay.\n\nHope that clear things up. I mean no disrespect to Muslims, but want to correct the misunderstanding of 'cleaning the blood'.\n\n-keith"
