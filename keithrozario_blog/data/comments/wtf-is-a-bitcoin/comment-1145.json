But there are online wallets, that store the coins, it's those online wallets like Mt.Gox that were hacked.\n\n\nIn theory bitcoin can be used to buy anything, but since it's quite new not many merchants accept them. It has however, become the default way of trading on the black market, so a lot of really dodgy stuff is currently being traded with Bitcoin, but expect that to change."
