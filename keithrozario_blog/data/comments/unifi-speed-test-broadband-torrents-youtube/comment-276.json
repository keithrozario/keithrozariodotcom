  "content": "Hey Joseph,\n\nThanks for the comment, and what you've just said confirms what I've suspected so far. The main concerns around Unifi is it's reliability and availability, very few seem to have complaints around it's performance.\n\nLike you said, you're very satisfied with Unifi when there's no fault. Same goes for me.\n\nI think most people out there love their Unifi connectivity, however the way TM handles it's downtime needs to be improved. \n\nIn conclusion though, what I can say is that TM gets an A+ for speed, but a C- for customer service with regards to downtime.\n\nWhat do you think?"
