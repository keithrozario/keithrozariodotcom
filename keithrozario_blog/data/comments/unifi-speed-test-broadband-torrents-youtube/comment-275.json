  "content": "Totally agrees with you and the older post you complaining about Unifi's customer service. Systems fail from time to time and customer service is what fixes it quickly.\n\nI'm very satisfied with Unifi when there's no faulty happening.\n\nThere was once a month me getting disconnected from the connection and couldn't get back on again after rebooting the devices for at least 5 times during the same month. At least most of the time, it got fixed the next day or so. However, it shouldn't fail this often. It just seems like they are taking shortcuts in resolving my problem and the problem keep persisting after a while.\n\nLuckily, I've been experiencing smooth internet connection for some months without any downtime now. Maybe they took more time than they should in really fixing the problem which is a problem that should be fixed. ;)"
