  "content": "As a researcher in the field of IAQ, I am very impressed with your work and the analysis that you have made on the comparison of API and PSI. I also agree that new electronic devices that are used to measure PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 are usually very expensive. The price of a high precision PM equipment ranges from 30k to 50k, according to a well-known product supplier. Anyway, Keep up with the good work, my friend."
