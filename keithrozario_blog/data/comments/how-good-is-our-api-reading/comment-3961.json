  "content": "The law will bring nowhere. Pollution is so high that science cannot collect prove to esthablish a crimininal activity. A huge part of science is into corruption and they allow or make more pollution. Air pollution is not legal nor allowed by the Catholic Church. Air pollution is used as a weapon in the name of peace, therefore one can get sick when working against such masonery of nazi peace. The solution is avoid to pay products that pollute the air and are not produced by your nation. You can get such product in any way it is possible and skip payments. These are the golden rules that are missing and that need to be applied to solve this issue of a jungle out of its territory where jail guards are substituting the real government. If they don't stop the jungle then you can avoid payment of products produced as well from your nation."
