  "content": "Hi Keith: Good effort and good attempt. However, I detect some flaws in your assumptions of your tests. You are assuming correlation of yr data based on similarity in size and distance in yr control sample data of Inner and Outer KL. I think it is over simplistic. More critical variables like wind direction changes, topography, population density and traffic volume play important part in the API readings."
