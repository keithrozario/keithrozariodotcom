  "content": "Aiyaaa why you pour cold water on people X-D \n\nI find that sometimes aiming for a goal can also be demotivating. If you are not getting nearer to it quickly enough, or you suffer setbacks, you feel dejected. So sometimes what I do instead is I just decide today what I want to do, or what kind of a person I want to be. I want to be fit? Then today I shall be the kind of person who is fit, and so today I'm going to go to the park for my morning walk. Getting into the habit of doing what the kind of person you want to be does helps us maintain the trajectory."
