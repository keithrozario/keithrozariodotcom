  "content": "Good article. I want to add that the UN Human Rights Declaration http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml article 19 (freedom of expression) where Malaysia is also a signatory to. Many laws here go against the declaration. However many ASEAN countries also do not abide by what they signed. Even the USA suggested the countries don't sign when they are not ready.\n\n\nAbout trusting the government - first, we need to ensure the judiaciary is independent again. Look at what is happening in Egypt. The new president wants sweeping powers once elected.\n\nBy the way, dropping off snail mail Can be anonymous but beware security cameras that can catch you in the act, just saying."
