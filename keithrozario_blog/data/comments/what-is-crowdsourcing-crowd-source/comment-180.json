  "content": "Hi Sandra, \n\nThe fact that you think my article has helped you puts me over the moon. I never really thought of crowdsourcing that way, and you do make a very very valid point. Crowdsourcing is probably the most non-judgmental way of sourcing work. There is no age-limit, or racial bias here, it's a free for all. Which means that anyone, even those with bipolar or more severe diseases could find work, albeit in the \"make hay while the sun shines\" way.\n\nThat being said, just like any other form of your work, you get paid based on the quality of your work...and sometimes that's not enough to make a living. Crowdsourcing has lived in the amateur circles for a long time, while some make more than enough to sustain their living--those are the exception, not the rule. \n\nThe good news is that no matter what passion you have, there's an online community for you, and most of the time that online community is willing to pay. If you're a t-shirt designer there's threadless, if you're a coder there's topcoder.com, there's etsy for hand made products and the list goes on. \n\nI would suggest figuring out your patients real passions, and then finding that community for them to pursue it full time. I wish you the best of luck and feel free to contact me if you need any help.\n\nI can't be believe I never thought of crowdsourcing from the this perspective, because what you've just said makes so much sense.\n\nThanks for commenting on the blog. Hope you keep visiting.\n\nkeith"
