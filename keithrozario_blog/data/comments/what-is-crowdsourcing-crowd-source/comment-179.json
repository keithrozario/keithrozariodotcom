  "content": "Hi, I'm a private practice psychiatrist in the US.  I learned about crowdsourcing from a recent Wall Street Journal article.  I was encouraged to hear about this type of employment.  \n\nI have a number of patients who are quite disabled by chronic psychiatric medical illness who are on government Social Security Disability.  Several have bipolar disorder who when younger were able to maintain employment but as the illness progressed, fluctuations in energy and mood now prevents him/her from sustaining a work task for an extended period of time that is enough to maintain employment that would allow for financial independence.With something like crowdsourcing, a person disabled by bipolar disorder can \"make hay while the sun shines\", or do some sort of task while he/she is having a time of relatively stable mood and stamina.  A patient with say Krohn's or ulcerative colitis can do a few tasks when he/she is not having to make it to the toilet more than 10 times a day.  I appreciate that your article has given me an idea of the different sorts of work available."
