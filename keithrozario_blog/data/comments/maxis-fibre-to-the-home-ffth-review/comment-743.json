  "content": "Just bumped into this blog. Actually.. this method has been used all around Europe by telco providers. What I understand is, yes the router would broadcast 2 SSID's. Apart from that, different SSID will have their own dedicated speed, and your own SSID would not be affected by the other SSID. This would also mean, 2 separate stream of lines broadcasted, but shared under 1 fiber."
