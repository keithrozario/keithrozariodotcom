  "content": "Maxis have changed the terms and condition. Clause 9. \"Maxis reserves the right to introduce and deliver new services over the shared infrastructure...\"\n\nBasically means the same thing but just hidden. We just wouldnt know.\n\nIts just unethical for maxis to do this. This offloading of 3G signal to wifi is only applicable for common areas like lobby, bus stations, train stations etc and not residential.\n\n"
