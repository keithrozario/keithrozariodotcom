  "content": "I first met Aiman when I married his mum's cousin in 1990. His maternal grandmother and my husband's mum were very close sisters who loved and enjoyed spending time with each other. After marriage I worked and lived near their home and I often dropped by, almost because his grandmother was a sweet and nurturing lady. Aiman was about 5 yrs old then. I had noticed that he loved to read and especially the newspapers. It seemed that he read every corner of the paper. I was intrigued when later he would rattle of bits and pieces of information to those who were around him. The popular news at the time was about the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina and I was fascinated by the way he pronounced the name and related the incidences. In fact his general knowledge about many things were quite profound compared to kids his own age and for that matter, even other older normal children. His other loves were of map reading and drawing, especially that of roads and streets. He would draw from the perspective of a bird's eye view and that with the advancement of technology has inadvertently helped him to gain recognition somewhat from his abilities. What you have read of Aiman is only the tip of an iceberg. I'm sure if his grandmother were alive she would be so proud of him. \n\n"
