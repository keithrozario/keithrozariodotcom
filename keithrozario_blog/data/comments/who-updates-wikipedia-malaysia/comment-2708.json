  "content": "Just to inform that Aiman has passed away yesterday evening (10th dec) in his sleep. He was otherwise a healthy person, and still very cheerful and as usual telling me about his latest updates on highways in his highway blog , and that he regrets that he cannot go to sarawak (where i live) to see the roads and bridges there (he knew more abt the roadmaps and years bridges were constructed than me), i told him that he could still go any time he wanted to. I was quite annoyed that he used the word cannot instead of have not. And that was just 24 hours before he left us to be wt his Maker. We will miss him dearly. ?"
