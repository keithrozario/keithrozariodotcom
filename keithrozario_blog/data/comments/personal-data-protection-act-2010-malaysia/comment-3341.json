  "content": "As July 2015, Malaysia PD commissioner have not address few more things like IP address, breach notification, empathize on data integrity &#038; security (strong encryption) and transmission of data to other countries.\n\nHowever, Singapore PDPA provide a guidelines as is:\nAre IP addresses personal data?\n\"Q:  Are organisations allowed to use cookies for behavioural targeting?\n  A: 8.11 - Where behavioural targeting involves the collection and use of personal data, the individual's consent is required.  http://goo.gl/0v05E7\n\nTM force Ads, https://goo.gl/U9B4Qc would be (violating) data protection principle?! And any service which provides services electronic commerce either transaction based or ads based (including blog/new portal) MUST provide secure (https) connection [principle 4], right?\n\nfew more question though which are not clear: \n1. how do you as data subject get to know that you data being collected and process by data users (after consent were granted)? does data users require to ask for consent (again) if they want to acquire new data from data subject?\n2. How do you get access (personal data) from them (more than 400++ and increasing)? \n3. Do you need to sent them letter 1 by 1 or sent 1 to PD commissioner so get them to access on your behalf? How do track this activities? Does PD commissioner provide a dashboard? \n4. And 1 of important  thing is who beared the cost for such activities - access &#038; update?"
