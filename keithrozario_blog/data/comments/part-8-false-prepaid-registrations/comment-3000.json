Actually, we ourselves as the owner of our own personal information should have the option to as much view it. Or else no one knows if that piece of information has been altered. (Just what Singapore is doing recently - https://myinfo-api.app.gov.sg/)\n\nAnyway, while researching about Digital Identity system, I came across https://e-estonia.com/. \nSurprising to me (GMPC project is almost amazing to me reading the white paper, almost), we actually initiated the MyKad project back in 1997! (Rolled out in 2001). But, it has been 20 years since then, and compared to how Estonia has scaled their national ID system, we basically did  nothing since 20 years ago. \n\nOh God. And why no one is worried about the recent eKYC processes defined by Bank Negara???????? \n\n- C"
