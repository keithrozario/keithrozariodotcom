  "content": "Hey. Thanks for getting back to me :) Managed to sort it out myself. I actually just couldn't even figure out how to enter a shell command through my nearlyfreespeech site control panel thing.\n\n\n If anyone else wanders along here: 1. Click on Sites tab across the top (i.e. where it says member home, profile, accounts etc). 2. Click on the 'short name' for your site. 3. A list of 'Actions' will appear on the right hand side of your screen. 'Run shell command' is one of them."
