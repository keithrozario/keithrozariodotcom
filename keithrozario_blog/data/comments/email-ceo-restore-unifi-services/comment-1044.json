Got a phone call from a Customer Serice rep on that dreadful day saying TM is offering a new package RM 199 to upgrade from my current VIP 5 to VIP 10 and to Platinum HYPP TV package. Fine its was all good coz i pay an extra RM 30 only for the upgrade.  And its a confirmation via phone deal (First time for me). And i was suppose to wait for an email few days later confirming it. I got it on the 8 Nov 2013....then rest is history...all the qualms i read here happened to me.\n\n\nToday is the 20 Nov 2013, till today no upgrades and worst still, my internet is being disrupted EVERY 30 minutes since then. I have made numerous calls and have got 3 reports numbers with me now. Tried emails, calls after calls....NOTHING!!\n\n\nMy advise is, if anyone calls you from TM CS asking you to upgrade, Please don't do it..."
