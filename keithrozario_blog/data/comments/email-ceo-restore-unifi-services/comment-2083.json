  "content": "Hi Keith, thanks for the courage. I face same problem with TM too. need a few long chats to talk to them, and seems things cannot get done. my case is to get rebate for faulty service after line termination. I wrote a very long email to a group of people which i dunno who yesterday. someone name Hazimi bin Kassim responded to my email and the next day i get a call from TM saying that they will investigate on this. But what i hope is the whole customer service system would be imroved.\nAnyhow, things still not resolved. \n\nfyr:\nhttps://www.tm.com.my/AboutTM/CorporateInformation/Pages/Who-We-Are.aspx"
