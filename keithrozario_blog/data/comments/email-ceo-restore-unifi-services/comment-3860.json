  "content": "I had a couple of bumps on the road with both Streamyx and Unifi and like you, their solution was to reset, flush, rinse and repeat. Apart from bad customer service I'm inclined to believe they are not willing to invest chunks of moolahs on REAL and PROPER technology, which explains why we get a half-arsed internet service. They have yet to convince me they have a dash of technical knowledge."
