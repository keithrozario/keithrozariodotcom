  "content": "Just got stood up by Unify contractor today and the didn't even have the courtesy to notify that it had been cancelled until I called to complaint. This is really bad, they confirmed my order super fast on 30/10, promising the sky and heaven and even date of installation .. but have no courtesy to inform that they had to change the installation date despite having 9 days in their hands.\n\nCalling to call desk doesn't help either, she could only offer sorry that no one contacted myself and almost immediately I received an sms for new appointment.. I simply don't have the confidence that they will treat us, customers seriously.\n\nI have asked for compensation since it was TM who had made the last minute change of appointment, however, the call centre lady replied politely that this penalty only applies if customer made the last minute change...hahaha. \n\nCan't help laughing on how big corporate makes unilateral terms and bully the consumers. At least, I have my complaint ticket number.. lets see where did it goes from here.."
