  "content": "Just read the whole discussion. The main reason your internet is slow is because of the shitty Unifi router that they gave u. Before calling them to complain, do this..get yourself a better router, Asus preferrably but any brand that supports Unifi/Maxis should work. Update the firmware on the router then test it on Unifi for a week. You will be surprise that most of the problems will suddenly disappear."
