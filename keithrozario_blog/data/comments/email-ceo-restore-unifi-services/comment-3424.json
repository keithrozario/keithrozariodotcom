  "content": "My email to TM below and no actions yet\n\nI made a call to your customer service department yesterday at around 5.15pm, Ms Sathia picked up my call. My unifi line was barred without any reason and I was unable to use my services- for clarification I called your centre and Ms Sathia informed me that it was due to overdue amount, but I have explained to her that according to your letter to us, I am suppose to receive a credit adjustment in bill which will only reflect in my october - therefore I was not required to do payment till then. But since I did receive the Sept bill with a wrong credit adjustment, I was unable to make payment as well. Couple of days ago - I received a letter that mentioned the credit adjustment amount - on my own I did a payment of RM300+ on 17th October, but TM disconnected my service on 18th Oct without any valid reason. So Ms Sathia apologized and said she will fix the problem ASAP for me.\n\nI had to send a business email which cost me RM85k urgently and  waited till 6.30pm and the problem not resolved, And I call again - MS Nadia picked up the call, I told her the entire scenario again and she was damn rude by saying \" Reconnection is not MAGIC,\" and when i said I want to speak to the team Leader she said \" NO ONE WANTS TO SPEAK TO ME BECAUSE OF MY STUPID REQUEST\" and she put me on hold FOR 15MINS Without any communication and she hang up the phone. NO EXPLANATION OR DETAILS OR APOLOGY GIVEN.\n\nAny suggestions ?"
