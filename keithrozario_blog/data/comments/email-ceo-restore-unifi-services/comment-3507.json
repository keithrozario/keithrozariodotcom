  "content": "We have the exact same problem. The internet failed 30 Sept, My son made the compliant (my wife &#38; I were abroad) &#38; was told a TM Eng would come on Sat 6th. The TM Eng arrived Sun 7th &#38; said its an external cable problem. On Monday (my son took the day off) another TM Eng arrive &#38; replace the fibre cable, apparently a rat had chewed through it. He said the internal modem was also at fault  &#38; was  unable to connect  us to TM/unfi and that another TM Eng would come later in the day. That TM Eng called at 5.50pm to say we must make another report. . . . . . still no internet connection. \nTonight a very sweet girl at TM will listen to my problem and apologise &#38; will be very sorry &#38; make a report &#38; say she will do all she can to resolve my service &#38; then she will remind me to give her high marks, if were requested to do so. I will then have to wait on TM service Engineers to call &#38; arrange another day to meet at their convenience &#38; maybe receive the service I'm paying for"
