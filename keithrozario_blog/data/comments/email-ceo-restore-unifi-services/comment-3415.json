When I went to TMPoint to \ncollect my cordless phone I was told that I have to get from TM's \nsub-con instead but when asked the technician who came to my house, he \nsaid I have to get from TMPoint. What a lousy service from a big company\n like Telekom. I had made several complaints but until not I still not \ngetting my modem. So for a new subscriber for upgrade, don't be fool by \nTMNET and become a victim like me."
