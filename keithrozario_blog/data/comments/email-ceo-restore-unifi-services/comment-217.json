  "content": "Hey Emkay,\n\nunfortunately, Unifi has been pretty disappointing in their service delivery. Although 3Mbps isn't as bad as some of the stories I hear, you still have a right to be upset with the quality, try a complaint to SKMM but they didn't really help me in my report.\n\nOn a separate note, if you send over the screenshot of a 3Mbps download and 10Mbps upload, I'll be glad to post it up.\n\nTHanks."
