  "content": "I purchased 2 movies from TM's IPTV on sept 17. Both movies played for about 2minutes and then  all i could see was garbled picture , something like what astro would be when it rains or when you buy a cheap pirated CD. Called the tm number and after the usual long wait, as what keith experienced, she could not promise me any concrete action that they will take, and they will not call me back. I was told that the charges for the 2 movies which i could not see, will still appear on my bill, and when i receive the bill, i should call again to report and ask for a reversal. If TM is serious  about service, their ceo should lead the way and take his job seriously."
