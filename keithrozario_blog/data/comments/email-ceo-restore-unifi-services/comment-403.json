  "content": "Tm?? wat can we expect from them.. I live in terengganu n sometimes i feel they treated us here like a second class citizen plus with no brain watsoever. \nAbout 2 weeks ago modem in my house was not functioning. When I sent it to tm branch they said the modem  cannot be used anymore and they cannot replace it as it's no longer under the warranty so they cannot do anything. Yesterday i went to one of the tm branch and asked the staff there what should i do.. The staff told me i can buy a new modem at tm points.. So i went there and unfortunately, there's no available stock. But the staff there said, i can buy modem at computer shops. To make it short, i bought a  modem at a computer shop and when there was a configuration problem i tried consulting tm but to my horror, they said its my own problem because i bought it myself..So today, I spent my whole day contacting the customer service and finally, after Asar, Pok Harun the tm staff arrived. To my surprised, my old modem is still okay, only the problem with the modem plug which will cost me around Rm 15. I bought a new modem which cost me Rm150 for nothing.. So please la inept tm staff weyy, if you dont have the expertise just admit it and don't make other peoples' life miserable.."
