  "content": "Dear Dato' Seri Zamzamzairani bin mohd Isa,\n\nYou obviously do not know what is going on at Unify. EVERY month my Internet connection is barred after many attempts at explicating to them that I have never defaulted on my monthly payment. Unify is tarnishing TM's name .... it's going down the drain and is dragging you name with It.\n\nIt looks like incompetent people are running what I call a Show.\n\nI CALLED AND EXPLAINED THAT I HAVE BEEN PAYING VIA ONLINE BANKING EVERY MONTH .. THEY CHECKED AND SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND AND RECONNECTED IT.\n\nTHEY SENT ME A MESSAGE ON 3 APRIL 2015 AT 2.15PM  THANKING ME .... AND ELEVEN MINUTES LATER AT 2.26PM ....THEY SENT ME ANOTHER MESSAGE TELLING ME THAT THEY ARE BARRING MY ACCOUNT!!!!\n\nTHIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR FOR MONTHS.\n\nMy name : Satheesan Raghavan\n\nMy account number: 1022480063\n\nMy service number : 60356121413\n\nI am a retired graduate teacher ( government ) .... ten years older than you. Please get ALL my details from Unify including my phone number and email address.\n\nAs the CEO I would like to see how effective and capable you are.\n\nSincerely,\n\nS Raghavan."
