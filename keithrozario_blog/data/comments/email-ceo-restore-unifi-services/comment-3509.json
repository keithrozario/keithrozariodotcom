  "content": "Seven years has passed since you wrote to the CEO, and now a new CEO and do you think things have changed?\n\nI was about to do the same you did 7 years ago when I came across your blog. My issue was simpler than yours but let me assure you it was just as frustrating, if not worse.\n\nLong story short. I called them everyday to resolve the issue and every time the same canned promises were made. We will try to resolve your problem as soon as possible. And at one time they even promised me within 24 hours or less. That was when I shouted at them in the phone. Sometimes that's the only way to get the message across to them but NOT with TM. Do you think threatening to write to the CEO would make them piss in their pants? They'll probably LOL while ROTF because their CEO has a better canned reply!\n\nBut, you'll never know with the new broom. Let's see if he sweeps clean. I'll write to the new CEO, and we'll compare notes later."
