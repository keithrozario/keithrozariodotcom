  "content": "Hi Keith, American CEOS are different from Asians. For them complains are opportunities for betterment. For instance when emailed a complain on landscaping to YB Khalid then the MB of Selangor, he responded to my email and requested his secretary to look into the issues immediately and gave the contact info of his secretary too. The MPK head then Tuan Mislan to responded . When Azmin was MB he did not respond to my complains and was the same with the former MPK head. \nNow coming to TM Unifi - they are daylight robbers of Malaysians. The cost vs speed in Asian region clearly shows we are overcharged and getting lower speeds compared to our neighbours. I have highlighted on their Customer Unfriendly Offers / Deals . TM should realize that they are a Customer orientated Company thus 'No Customer , No Company'. \nYB GS Deo has made the right move to improve our Telcos which are robbing Malaysians. TM and ASTRO plus TNB are all doing the same. The rakyat should feedback and voice out for their rights as Customers.\nI hope Changes take place soon. I have feedback in several websites and \neven Change . org.\nHave a nice day\nR."
