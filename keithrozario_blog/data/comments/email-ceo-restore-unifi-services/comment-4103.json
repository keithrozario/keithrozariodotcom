  "content": "i did my payment on 4 Sept through Tm portal  which showed  unsuccessful and  I did the  2nd payment at the same time  form Tm portal which showed unsuccessful again. Later received  via sms  at 22: 14 and 22: 18  hrs stating  payment received . With this double payment has been made. \nSince there is double debit to my credit for the same payment. I had to visit TM office to enquire.  Having a tide schedule i went to Tm office at Taman Tun Aminah to solve this matter.  TM staff question whose portal I had used to make the payment. It's common sense, if  you are paying your TM bill, you would use TM portal and staff blamed the Bank for the mistake. I was then  referred to the Customer Services (CS)staff (counter 2). The CS was not  confident in replying to my matter, she said MUNGKIN....She made me wait at her counter 2 for 15 mins without  giving a proper answer and said we are working on it. I request to speak to the Supervisor , but was told he is not in the office  As i had other matters to attend, I had to leave and told the staff  to reply on my email. They wrote down my hand phone contact number and told me that the supervisor will contact me. This has cost inconvenience to me and TM staff are not trained  to handle customers  and issues related to TM. Hope to hear from TM  with a positive reply. Thank you."
