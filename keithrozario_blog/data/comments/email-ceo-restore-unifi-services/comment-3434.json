  "content": "The worst Customer Service ever. I've been charged by RM 10 for reconnection fee. I always pay RM 199, but they forgot to give the campaign price for me, so they said I should pay more. I just want to pay 199 every month based on the agreement. But, then, suddenly, I got disconnection service for the outstanding amount, which is I am not supposed to pay. Then now, they are asking another RM 10, what an extra hidden cost??!! Great marketing from them to gain more money, applause for their creativity!"
