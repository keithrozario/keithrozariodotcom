  "content": "I am the next person to have shitty service from TM. This is another hopeless company that is being back by Government otherwise the staffs eat shit. Calls made to them will have brainless staffs who will get you to hold on while they check which take easily more than 40 minutes with no solution in sight.  After that they promised to call back which eventually never till the next century.  From experience I have encountered in the past, never to have any subscription from government link companies unless necessary.  "
