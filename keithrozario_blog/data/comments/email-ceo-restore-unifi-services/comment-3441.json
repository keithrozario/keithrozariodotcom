  "content": "Telekom is a giant monopolised axxhole. They didn't care much about their customer since they know they are the only fast speed ISP in the region. You don't want to use, you get lost. I don't care a damn. This is their CEO attitude. But think back, who make them become so arrogant? Is us the customer with majority who like to keep silence for any issue. We should stand up and fight for our right instead. Let's gather together to eliminate the monopoly and let the serious players come in to split the market. Only with more competitors get into the market then customers can enjoy a fair service."
