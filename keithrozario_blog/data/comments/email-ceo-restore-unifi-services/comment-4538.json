After change to 300 Mbps last few days call customer service due to speed test was less than 50 Mbps until tv cannot watch YouTube show. The Unifi customer  service ask me turn off the Unifi white box then less than one minutes turn on again but the tv still cannot watch due to less than 50 Mbps. What is happening ask me to upgrade 300 Mbps  but unifi still less than 50 Mbps. I feel like being cheated due to less Mbps. Pls check &amp; let me know as soon as possible. Tq"
