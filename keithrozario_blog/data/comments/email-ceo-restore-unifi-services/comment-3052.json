I have been calling to asked for the status and they are like a robot repeating the same things to me: ' we will help you to check miss, btw we can't promise you our technical and construction  team can reconnection n solve the problem by the day, it's because the underground cable have been stolen!!!!!! This construction project shall forward my issues to the technical people.......bla.....bla......bla....., I paid the service for every single day not just working day. I cannot do anything, what is can do is call 100 then repeat the stupid things again and again!!!!!! We paid the fee portly, what about TM service????? Can I not pay TM for the 1 year for the disruption?"
