  "content": "Yup exactly what I'm facing at this current moment. Call center technicians AND billing department are a bunch of robot who:\n1) Gives the same lame \"Let me check\" line when they pick up your call and same stupid excuses (system down sounds familiar?)1) Will not pass your call beyond them to someone with more \"power\" to \"call back\" (military barrier?)2) Will not give you ANY email or number to complain and/or feedback (need I waste my precious time and money waiting for the 1300 to be picked up?)3) Will not commit to a time when your connection will be restored4) Will not pass the message and ask the technician in charge of reconnection to return a simple call of acknowledgementIt is VERY frustrating talking to these people, I seriously think that they're there just to stall you, bring you on a wild goose chase and in the end, still nothing is being done. \n\nMay I ask if your connection was ever reconnected after your post?"
