  "content": "Just last week I decided to unsubscribe the Streamyx at my father's place seeing that he hardly uses it. Decided that maybe i should get him a Yes dongle instead.\n\nCoz obviously my old man who just learnt how to use the computer less than a year ago is not doing any heavy upload or download activities on the Internet. Nor does he know how to play Internet games. So it's just mainly light Internet surfing.\n\nNow, I've heard that you need to be physically present at the tmpoint centre in order to terminate a service. But I refuse to believe that. I mean, this is an Internet service provider company. Whose parent company is a telecommunications service provider. Of all companies, I would expect this type of company to embrace the benefits of the virtual world where things can be done and verified online. I sent emails in the past but I did not hear back from them. So I decided to give them a call. A lady asked me tens of question, before passing me on to the technical team who asked me the same set of question, before telling me that I got to be present physically at the centre. People were right....speechless...\n\nSo last Friday, I sacrificed my lunch and went to the tmpoint in cyberjaya. Saw a ugly handwritten 'system down' sign on the door..speechless moment number 2. Was told to fill up some form. I didn't have my account number with me. They  to check from the systemAnd I also mention Streamyx like 3 thousand times.\n\nThen today I found out, that my unify connection was terminated instead (I hadn't the chance to check with my father if his Streamyx  is still active or not). They had .... terminated...the...wrong....service.... Speechless ...."
