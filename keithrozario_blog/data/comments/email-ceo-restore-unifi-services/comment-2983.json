  "content": "Hi Keith,\n\nJust wanna share my experience:-\n\n17May2018 - UNIFI was down since 17May2018 around 4am. Called in the morning, was informed that there has been 40+ users complaint, so they will fix it and we do not need to lodge report. Till evening after 6pm, UNIFI still donw. Called again, and was told that everything ok in our area, and they cannot check back the things happened in the morning (?????). Ask us to lodge report, and they will respond in 24 hours.\n\n18May2018 - UNIFI still down whole day. Called again and told that it is still in progress. TM unable to give date on when can be fixed, unable to give contact number of technical staff, unable to give any commitment. All they can do is apologised for inconvenience caused, which is insufficient in this situation and it is not helping in anyway.\n\n19May2018 - Live chat, and still given the same answer, no help at all to fix the problem.\n\n20May2018 - UNIFI down whole day.\n\n21May2018 - As at now 2pm, UNIFI still down, no update from TM. Finally, follow advice and lodge case to MCMC.\n\n22May2018 - A UNIFI technician called, and said need to visit my house and check internal.  Need to take leave and stay home to wait for them.  Still unknown whether can be solved by today.\n\nI think TM need to hire and train more technicians.  They need to commit to solve cases within SLA.\n\nThank you."
