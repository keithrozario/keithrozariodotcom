Bla bla bla\"\n\nAfter numerous calls I've made to call center at 100, Just about a min ago, finally a lady called me back, she claims that she is from 2nd level oso, what she did was, asked me did anyone from their technical team called me, I said NO, next she said:\"ok we will arrange our technician to make appt with you......\"\nOmg..... They promised me to come at 10am yesterday, we have been waited from yest 10am till now, n now they are telling me they cannot promise when technician can come AGAIN???!!! \n\nFor 6 days! Just a simple arrangement n TM services can screw up???!!! \n\nI requested to talk to an upper level or at least someone that can make decisions, they just told me I cannot do that, what is can do is to call 100 can repeat the stupid things again n again!\n\nWe paid the fees promptly, what about TM's service??? There is no SLA? Can I not pay TM for the 6 days for the disruption?"
