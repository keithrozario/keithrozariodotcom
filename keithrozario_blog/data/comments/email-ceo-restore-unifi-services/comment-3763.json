  "content": "Hearing that TM canceled the wrong service is truly heart-breaking. It's terribly&#160;disappointing&#160;that you sacrificed your lunch only for TM to say \"System down\" ...to me that is unforgivable.&#160;\n\nIt's sad to see a company with such bad customer service continue to reign on the back of a Government granted monopoly. Let's hope it'll only be a matter of time before TM make good on their promise and allow other 3rd parties access to their backbone."
