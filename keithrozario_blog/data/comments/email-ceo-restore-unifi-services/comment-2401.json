  "content": "Not only UNIFI. My Streamyx and phone has been out of service since September 2015. Nothing much has been done. Problem still persist. I called Customer Service more than they call me and their excuse is always the same... \"We will attend to it imediately\", \"Your case will be our priority\", \"Very sorry for the inconvenience\". TM shouldn't be call as Telekom Malaysia but should change to Tipu Malaysia."
