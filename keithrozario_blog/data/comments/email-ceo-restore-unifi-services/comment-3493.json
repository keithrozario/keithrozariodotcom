Even subcribing to TM is a problem to chase after. From twitter to facebook and lastly decided get help from agent. Oh my lord, why this company still survive these day. Even p1 is better than you exclude internet quality and pricing. \n\nJust yesterday my internet went down, not a month of usage there is a problem already. I tweet them about my problem but the staff seems do not want to help and spend hours to reply a single tweet. DM me with a long text bla bla bla and a report number which is different number from what I receive on mobile phone later that afternoon. Automated system begin to spam my mailbox. Restoration on progress, on delay. WHAT? I need a technician not those bunch of sms to give u hope but not solving the problem. \n\nThis is like curing a toxic with morphin. ridiculous."
