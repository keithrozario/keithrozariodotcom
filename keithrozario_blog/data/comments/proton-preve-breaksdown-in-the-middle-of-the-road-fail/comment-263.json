According to Proton Edar, the accident happened around 4.45pm yesterday where the red Proton Preve in the picture driven by a Proton Edar sales advisor hit a divider and landed in a such a manner that caused the lower arm to break, resulting in the awkward position of the front wheel in the photo. \n\nSo not too bad, the photo was posted up somewhere mid-evening on Friday, and at around 1am on Saturday Proton Edar was already on the case trying to combat the negative perception on facebook. They did not however, engage lowyat.net users, which is a shame, because that looks to be the source of the news. \n\n\n"
