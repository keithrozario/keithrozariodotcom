  "content": "Does having a bachelor degree in Multimedia is considered IT related courses? Man I'm confused what I want to further for my degree. But if the trend is getting better for IT, then I might have to continue studying in multimedia field. In fact, I already have my diploma in multimedia so everything should be okay. The only thing I hate is the programming subjects, it is by far the hardest subjects for me while studying multimedia."
