  "content": "I think more Malaysians like science subjects more than computer studies. In my university only about 25% of our science majors are taking computer science and the rest are pursuing biology, chemistry and psychology related subjects. And it's perfectly normal even where I come from parents emphasize their children to be doctors, pilots and other jobs that seem prestigious on the outside."
