  "content": "I think deep down inside most of us, we have this unrealized dream. Unrealized because we are too comfortable where we are, too comfortable with our regular paychecks, or....a little lazy. Therefore, seeing another person having the guts to take the leap to do something they dream of, gives us hope. And we don't mind contributing a few dollars to that. Few dollars for hope is an affordable price tag.\n\nAnd oh, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  A year older, a year wiser! Many happy returns of the day!"
