  "content": "That's a good point, but if I were to apply for a job as lawyer or banker or something completely 'non-creative' wouldn't the creativeness get in the way, I believe it's a great way to stand out, but sometimes the colors and themes, while nice and to provide a focus for the resume...distract a bit. Especially if you're a traditionalist when it comes to resumes,  and a lot of people are."
