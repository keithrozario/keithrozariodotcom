  "content": "Well, it's not just me Hiew. I haven't personally hacked a Wi-Fi connection yet, but I've been told by reliable sources that it isn't hard and the evidence on the web seems to suggest this is the case as well.\n\nIt could be that if you have a poorly secured Wi-Fi connection, someone in your neighbourhood could be stealing your Wi-Fi for their personal use, or worse-- to implicate you in a crime. Poorly secured Wi-Fi connections are like leaving the door to your house open at night, dangerous and insecure."
