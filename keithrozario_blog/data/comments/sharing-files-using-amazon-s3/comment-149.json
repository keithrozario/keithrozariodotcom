It looks like your normal run-of-the-mill ftp program, but it's got a cleaner interface with far better features (auto-backup, import/export jobs and even folder compare and auto-sync). Plus since Amazon S3 is far faster than most FTP and sFTP servers, the overall experience is pretty good.\n\nI'd like to use the application, but Amazons web interface does provide sufficient functionality for a low-end user like me. However, I can see why people would download your app and use it, particularly heavy duty users."
