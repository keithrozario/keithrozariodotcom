  "content": "I heard about the malaysian Govt banning the internet before the election (source: http://goo.gl/4JB3j). Its not fair to rob the people of their freedom. I would suggest the best possible solution to this problem and that is VPN. In my opinion people must be allowed to voice their opinions and reach out to the millions of users online and social media is the best way to achieve this."
