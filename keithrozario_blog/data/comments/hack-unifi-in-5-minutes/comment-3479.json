I'm a Unifi user with DIR-615 revision G2, it is very scary that I have affected to the password page exploit for more than 2 years without knowing it.. I have flashed my router to DD-WRT as I found out that there is no way for me to turn off remote access ( at least I cannot find it). I also written down my steps, if anyone interest can have a look. http://cakegiyh.blogspot.com/2014/01/flash-unifi-router-dir-615-g2-to-dd-wrt.html"
