  "content": "Usually an employee who can multitask is a person who have more skills compared to other employees.\n\nAnd the best employee is the employee who can multitask problems, not jobs but at the same time, his performance does not become static and he is not stress.\n\nUntil now, I have never meet that kind of stressfull IT person who can multitask-solving different problem and yet does not stress. I am often multi-task different problems, and I am stressfull almost everyday - and that is negative.\n\nBut then again, in Malaysia, some company does not care about prevention of problems, that is why it is stressfull, not because multi-tasking, but because some problems can be prevented - only if there is budget, and willingness of other people."
