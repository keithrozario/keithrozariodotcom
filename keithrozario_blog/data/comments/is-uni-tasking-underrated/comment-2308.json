  "content": "Most of the time the stress is due to a lack of performance, and the lack of performance is due to the multi-tasking nature.\n\nMost people have more than one job to do over a week or month, but time-boxing each individual task is more important than trying to do everything simultaneously.\n\nhowever, my main point is even if you focus on one task, it's hard to keep that focus for too long in todays distraction heavy world. Focus requires discipline, but I think it produces more effective outcomes."
