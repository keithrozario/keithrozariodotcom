  "content": "the pricing on itunes depends of Malaysian music labels. Maybe the price will stay due to Malaysians spending power is less thn USA.. price hike will cause fewer downloads and thus it will affect their earning.. Better for them to stick with the current pricing model. I hope near future itunes malaysia will introduces payment in RINGGIT like Singapore which is using SGD. I cant stand with current ups n down of ringgit. sometimes one song cost 3.12 then tomorrow 3.26 etc.[u might notice this, if u check yur credit card transaction record]. it might not cost too much if u happen  to buy one or two songs..But people like me who usually buy a lot of songs..it is costly"
