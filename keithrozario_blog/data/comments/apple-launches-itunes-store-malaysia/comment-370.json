  "content": "By the way, last weekend, iTunes drop price of few albums to USD2.49. Example is Elton John greatest hit with 30 plus songs at USD2.49. Teresa Teng with same number of songs same price. Jacky Cheung 2 albums at USD2.49 each. I didn't know iTunes randomly drop price without announcing to the world. \n\nAfter I found out this, I keep on logging into iTunes to check everyday if there's crazy deals like this. Yesterday I found 100 Love Songs for USD6.99. I've become addicted to shopping in iTunes Malaysia. :("
