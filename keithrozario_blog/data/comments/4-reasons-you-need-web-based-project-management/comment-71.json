  "content": "Thanks Robert. If you're worried about security, my advice would be teambox as well, but the paid hosted version rather than try to host it yourself. The reason is obvious, you're paying teambox to look after things like versioning, security and user management. That frees up your time to manage the real work, it's sort of outsourcing your IT department.\n\nIt is generally true that paid (premium) services are usually better \nthan those available for free, and if you're running a professional \nservice and want to focus on your actual product delivery and not worry about IT overhead, I'd definitely recommend a paid-service over a self-hosted project management tool.\n\nIn terms of AtTask I haven't looked at it, simply because my blog was focused on the options that were free. That's for the comments though, I may check it out in the future."
