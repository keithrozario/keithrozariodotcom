  "content": "I've looked into Teambox and am interested in its features, especially as I am thinking of freelance work. I've heard it is excellent for that. Currently, I am using a tool called AtTask which has been extremely helpful. I am able to manage higher workloads with no extra stress. AtTask actually just won the CODiE awards for \"Best Project Management Solution.\" It isn't free, however, but the thing about free software for managing businesses is the issue of security. These one's you mentioned seem decent, though.\nVery informative blog, thanks."
