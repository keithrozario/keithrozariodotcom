  "content": "Hi TDJ,\n\nI haven't yet purchased a Netflix subscription since I'm using the free one month trial, will give it a shot and let you know.\n\nYou might also try using a Maybank American Express card, that may be a slight loophole as it's the only card in Malaysia that you can purchase a Kindle Book from Amazon directly with.\n\nIf you have an Amex card it might be worth giving it a shot.\n\nRegards,\nKeith"
