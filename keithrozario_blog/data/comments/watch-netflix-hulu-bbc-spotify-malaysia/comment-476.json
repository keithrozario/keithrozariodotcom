  "content": "That's actually a very good question. For the time being UnoTelly supports multiple sites like Netflix, Hulu and even Amazon Prime. However, it doesn't support every site, so iTunes would not be covered by a Unotelly subscription, i.e. Unotelly would not apply to iTunes. However, because it applies to Amazon Prime, I'm intrigued to see if it applies to other Amazon services like the Kindle as well, I'll need to double check this and get back to you."
