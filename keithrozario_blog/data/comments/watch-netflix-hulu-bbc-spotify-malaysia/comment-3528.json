Hence not trying to sell it.\n\nThe licensing restrictions are a result of copyright protection gone wrong, when viewers in much richer developed countries get cheaper access to the same content. In some cases Americans get to view the content for free, while the rest of us have to watch it on subscription cable tv.\n\nI'm not sure which part of my post is racist? would you be able to point out which sentences were racist. I mean no offence to anyone, and if something somewhere here is offensive, I'll gladly take it down provided I know which part it is.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nKeith"
