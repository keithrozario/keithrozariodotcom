  "content": "Hi, I have a 10mb Unifi line but can't seem to stream Netflix &amp; Amazon On Demand in HD at all; but am able to do so for Hulu. Hence, it's not a bandwidth issue.\n\nHave you any luck in streaming Netflix in HD? I'm only able to stream HD via force buffering but the waiting time is long and annoying. http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/22556/manually-adjust-buffer-rate-in-netflix/\n\nIs it because Netflix servers are located far away from this region?"
