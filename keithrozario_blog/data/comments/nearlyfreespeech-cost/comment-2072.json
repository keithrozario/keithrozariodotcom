  "content": "Mahdi, \n\ngreat post - thanks for this. I've just switched from an ancient (11 year old) shared hosting plan, and decided that I'd had enough of vps admin (having to login every week and update the site). I wanted to spend more time learning something new. \n\nSo, instead of transferring my clunky wordpress over to nearlyfreespeech.net, I decided to give jekyll a go. My site is 180MB with images but I don't get any process charge. It's literally the storage and bandwidth. Not sure of how many hits I get yet, but it's going to work out much cheaper than the $10 I was paying before and much quicker than before."
