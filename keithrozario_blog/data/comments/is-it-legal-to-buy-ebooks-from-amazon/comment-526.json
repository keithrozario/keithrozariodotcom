  "content": "Sorry, I mistakenly quote on import tax. But Books are also exempted from sales tax. I cannot find the schedule A of the sales tax act but this document does cite on the exemption for books and magazines. http://202.190.126.187/en_v2/uploads/Publications_pdf/Guide_For_MalaysianManufacturers/English/english.pdf\n\n\noh, on another note, we could easily buy international e-magazines from zinio and magzter. even kobo sells some of their e-books in malaysia. i believe it is more on the malaysian dealer who want to make more money rather than any logistical or governance hindrance."
