  "content": "One thing I did was write a last letter to people I care about and seal it in an envelope to be opened when I die. Going through that thinking process of what I would want to say in that letter helped me put many things into perspective and rethink my priorities. I revisit the letter once every one or two years and rethink, recalibrate and update as appropriate."
