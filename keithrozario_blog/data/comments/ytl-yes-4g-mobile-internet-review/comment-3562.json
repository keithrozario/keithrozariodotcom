  "content": "I bought their Zoom router outright, paid RM399. Configured once and left it at 1 spot at home to use everyday for the next 2 years. 2 weeks ago, the device stopped working. I walked into their outlet at Lot 10, the technician tried to do a factory reset. After trying 4-5 times, his response is the device is not working anymore. My only option is to buy a new device. Yes, i know my warranty period has expired but they can't even try send the device for further troubleshooting or quote me to repair. Routers usually last for a very long time unless there's a power surge at home. Nobody messes with a router at home like a washing machine or oven. You just configured it and leave it there to work. I asked the technician for a confirmation report that the device is no longer usable and he said there's no such thing. He offered to print out the device information, e.g. MAC address, serial no., warranty period. What the heck can i do with these information?"
