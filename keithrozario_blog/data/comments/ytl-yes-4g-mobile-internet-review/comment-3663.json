  "content": "Their services are NO! Their services very SUCK at all. Even calling to their customer service hotline 0183330000. The AI will keep on telling your information to you. After few minutes its still the same and NO ONE will pick your phone to serve you. Most of the time their network coverage very small and slow. When you are inside a building or a house, you are probably not in service already!\n\nTheir email just for display purpose I think. I have sent few emails to them, but doesn't has any reply. Just let customer send the email for fun?\n\nSo please, everyone should think probably before you use this service provider :)"
