  "content": "I have had 2 different accounts with YES over a period of around 5 years. I closed the first account because I thought it was being hacked, but the same problem keeps happening. \n\nI now have the Super 98 deal with 10 gig. This month the 10 gig finished in 8 days, so I buy a 5 gig booster. That finished in one day so I buy another 5 gig. So far this month I have spent RM 250 and only half way through the month. My usage is only light, surfing the net and reading emails, no movies! After reading this blog it is now clear to me what I always suspected, \nYES CHEATS ON QUOTA!!\n\nAlso it is worth noting that as data gets cheaper the quotas increase, but only for new customers, so the old customers pay more than the new ones. Other providers automatically upgrade their existing customers when the quotas increase, but YES doesn't.\n\nA lot of people here are concerned about threats of legal action for unpaid bills. I suggest that these are bluff. You shouldn't be bullied into paying their bill if they have cheated or not provided the service that they were contracted to supply. Perhaps Kieth could connect us all up to initiate  a class action against them?"
