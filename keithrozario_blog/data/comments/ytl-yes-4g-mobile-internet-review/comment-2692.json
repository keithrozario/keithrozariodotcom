  "content": "I am facing a similar issue. I was 23 years old at the time unaware they were trapping me legally into the contract. I barely used it for 1 month and after 3 months my account was terminated which i though should put an end to it. They told me i am blacklisted, and i am an international student who is not working. Why should i pay for something that haven't used for 3 frigging years! We should group together and sue their asses off for this kind of trickery at consumer court. If you guys are interested, email me at hizuna786@gmail.com so we can all meet and do something about it!"
