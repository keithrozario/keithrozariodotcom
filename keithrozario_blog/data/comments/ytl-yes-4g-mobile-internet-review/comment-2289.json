  "content": "This actually happened to me but with P14G service. I already asked them to terminate my service via phone call after the contract. 1 year later i received a call from a lawyer saying that I have an outstanding payment of almost 1k. I told them that I have not been using the service, so why do I need to pay? I called up P1 and asked them what actually happened, they say they never get any termination notice from me. So I had to pay up 1k to clear my name from AKPK black list.\n\nI believe YES 4G also use the same tactic with their customers. Use or not, you still have to pay. As P1 informed me, if I've not been using the service, the fault is on 'my side' not 'their side' bcs they still provide the service, it's my lose I've not been using. Total loss: 1k and lifetime regret for ever trusting any of these companies.\n\nNow I'm using YES Zoom. The connection is very unstable with speed 0.01Mbps. But I still pay because my contract is yet to end. I will terminate when the time comes and subscribe Unifi."
