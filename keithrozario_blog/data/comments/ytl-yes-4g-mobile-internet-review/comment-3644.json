  "content": "I think we all have a similar experiences and cases here of victims to Yes broadband company being chased for debt that we shouldn't being charged. I had the similar experiences to 5164 (@Eunnjooo) that I've stopped my services , returned devices to them and yet they still comes after me for bill amount of 1000 + which I'm totally unaware of when I terminated my account at the counter and no one inform me this info. I personally think we have enough numbers and form a community to file our complaint to the right authority or government department to check on all these debt they trying to collect from their victims."
