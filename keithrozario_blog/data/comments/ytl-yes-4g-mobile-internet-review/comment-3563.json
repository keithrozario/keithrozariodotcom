  "content": "I agree. Total rip-off service with horrible customer care. Go into their store and it will take you an hour to get out of there. If you deviate from their script by one word - ie: you have an existing device but don't have a Yes ID - they'll break down and just keep asking you the same question over and over and over again. Their wireless devices aren't even wireless; my Huddle device can't stand 1 hour without being charged. It's like I'm living in 2001 with a long USB cord attached to a device bigger than my wallet."
