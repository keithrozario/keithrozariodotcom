Supposedly to be the best 4G in town .. well wat da heck got it for free ... somehow after using it for almost 2 months now &amp; suddenly yesterday it stopped working totally ... upon checking today with YES CRM, they told me ... \"Sir, you've used up all your quotas\" ... God my average daily usages were below 100mb ... suddenly yesterday it shot up to 1.5GB in one day ... Die man!! sure die one!!! ... now I hv no internet service and was told to wait till end of July b4 I can use it back ... phew!! .. somebody must hv hijacked my databits as I was at a public area when it happened yesterday ....sigh ... there's no warning of high usage at all ...it's like YES condone to such \"robbery\"... shame on you ..."
