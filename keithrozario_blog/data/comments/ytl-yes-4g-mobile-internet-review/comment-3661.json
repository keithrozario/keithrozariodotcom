  "content": "Hi peeps,\n\nI have moved from KL, back to my kampung. I have been using Yes postpaid 4GB quota plan for 4 years. Then I heard and subscribed to Yes Fiz unlimited plan which offer 1Mbps. The first year, no problem. But in the 2nd year, there comes the problem. Speed sometimes inconsistent. Download 1.03Mbps, upload 0 Mbps. Even worse, sometimes no connectivity at all. I have to turned ON/OFF the modem many times to get the signal. Luckily, I have another 4 months before Yes contract ends and I have been thinking to subscribe Streamyx plan since no Unifi coverage in my area. This will be my last time subsciption with Yes. Honestly, Yes need to improve coverage and connection instead of focusing on new plans with few improvement. That's all, folks."
