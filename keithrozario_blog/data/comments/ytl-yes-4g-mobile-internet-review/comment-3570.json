  "content": "Yes provides the worst customer service. When they think payment is not received, they will not notify/make any inquiry first. They just cut the service without even discussing reasons/options with the customer first. In my situation, I had actually already made payment, but they did not receive notification of payment for some reason - so they barred my account outright. I informed them that I had indeed made payment, and e-mailed them proof of payment, but they refuse to unbar my account until they are investigate further. Seriously, do I have to prove to these people that I deserve their internet??? I would rather just switch a more customer-friendly service provider elsewhere."
