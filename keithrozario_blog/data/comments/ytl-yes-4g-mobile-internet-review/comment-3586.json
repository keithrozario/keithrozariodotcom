  "content": "same here, they're not calling me when my bill is ready to pay, so i suspect they terminate my acc... after a year, they said my bill is rm1000.. wth i said,, they never call me b4,, even no message they send me, suddently i must play for 1k? i prefer TM more, atleast TM will call you if your bill is higher than rm200.. they will said why,how.. if we cant continue the payment, they will terminate imediately even the contract still on.. but not like yes, they dont tell/call.. how we know... especially when we open the acc for our child/mom under our name.. and one more thing is we cant limit the speed, i know its 4g.. but for example if we hv quota 16gb but the speed is more than 12mbps.. it will consume all the data.. if you watch youtube/any video on the internet/download big file (eg. 6gb file). it will consume all 16gb quota.. bcoz we cant limit the speed.. thats why im very frustrated with yes . (sorry if my english is too bad)"
