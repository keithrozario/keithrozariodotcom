  "content": "If you still pay installments, what else they do to you?Do you receive any letter from the law firm earlier?  I'm in the same condition as you. My debt is 1,5++ and I got letter from law firm which said I need to pay the whole amount in 10days or else they will take action towards me. I can't afford to pay a whole amount once, if I pay them installment would they still take action? What is the next step after they sent you letter from the law firm? I shouldn't took this fuckin broadband if I know this will happened. Sigh~"
