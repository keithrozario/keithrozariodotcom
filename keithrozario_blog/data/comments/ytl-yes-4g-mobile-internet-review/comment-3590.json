  "content": "I'm new YES broadband user, just bought the Zoom prepaid starter pack last month, which cost me more than RM400.\n\nYesterday there was heavy rain in my area, and after that my Zoom wifi router's signal drop significantly from 4 bars to 1 bar only, which eventually I can't browse the Internet at all due to weak signal.\nSo I called YesCare Customer Support 0183330000, the YES agent told me that there was something wrong with the tower in my area and the technician was fixing it as we speak, probably will be fixed by yesterday night or today morning, asked me to try again later.\n\nHowever, this morning I don't see any changes at all, 1 bar signal, can't even browse Google. So I called them again, gave my YES ID, asking why the problem still persists since yesterday I called in. The agent checked and told me there is nothing wrong with the tower in my area, and he doesn't see any report from the previous agent that I spoke with yesterday.\n\nSo the agent I spoke with yesterday was actually lie to me eventough I told him that I got very important presentation that I need to use my Internet without interruption today afternoon. How could he?\n\nAnd I spent more than RM20 calling them. Those agent always asked me to do some useless troubleshooting, which doesn't solve the problem at all.\n\nIf anything happened to my presentation this afternoon, I gonna crush the YES Zoom wifi router with a hammer and put it on youtube. Son of a bitch!\n\n*This is not the first time I got weak signal. The previous one was much worse."
