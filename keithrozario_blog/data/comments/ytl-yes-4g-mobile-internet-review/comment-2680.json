I should read this blog &amp; comments before my friend made her payment to yes when she received the following message this morning:\n\nEN/PN xxxxxxxxx AKAUN YES4G xxxxxxxx TELAH LAMA TERTUNGGAK RM109.10. HARAP MAKLUM, PERMOHONAN UNTUK PINJAMAN/KREDIT DAN SYARIKAT TELEKOMUNIKASI YANG LAIN AKAN DISEKAT SEKIRANYA TIDAK MEMBUAT PEMBAYARAN DENGAN SEGERA. HUBUNGI KAMI DI 03-40507838 ATAU 017-4557533 UNTUK BANTUAN. TERIMA KASIH\n\nAccording to her, she bought this in 2014 while she just returned from overseas, used it for two three months then switch to unifi. She never cancel the account.\n\n2.\nAnd this is my experience when I tried to activate a free Yes sim card, I have just spoken to an unfriendly + unpleasant voice tune staff a moment ago.  In fact I hv selected button 2-English, but a Malay speaking lady attended to me (no wonder my friend complained to me every time she called, the staff will speak BM, and my friend no good in BM). Asked her questions, if yes, she will just replied \"emng\", if no, she will just said \"tak boleh\" then full stop, no further explanation.  End conversation no greetings like others service centre; neither \"is there any other questions I can help?\" nor \"thank you for calling xxxx have a nice day\" \n\nFirst thing  they need to improve is train their staff. \n\nI will forgo the free Yes sim card."
