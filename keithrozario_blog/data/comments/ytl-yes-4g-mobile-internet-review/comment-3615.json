  "content": "Gracious, I've experience something similar to yours,as a student I can really relate to the financial burden. Apart from the lousy connection and power starving YES Huddle, my YES account was abruptly terminated without my consent. Which lead to penalty due to termination. And they insist on me paying the full penalty amount when I had never even agreed to any termination at all. Very disappointing, I would never recommend YES to anybody, especially students."
