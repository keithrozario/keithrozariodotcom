  "content": "I purchased one Yes product in 2012 and used it for 2 months only. The service was of absolute poor quality. Unreliable customer service. 4 years later, exactly 2 days ago a moron from a collection company from Sepati or whatever, claiming to represent Yes says I have to pay RM800 and he can push it down to RM600. Today he called again i  a rude voice \"Regarding my discount, are you interested or NOT? If you refuse to pay in 2 days we will send you a legal letter. Wow Tan Sri Francis Yeoh, owner of YTL Corporation that own Yes, for someone who appears to be religious and God fearing, you sure know how to exploit your ex-customers! Disgusting."
