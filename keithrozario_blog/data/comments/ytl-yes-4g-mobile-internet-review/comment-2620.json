  "content": "I've been using Yes Home Internet for quite some time now and before that I used to use Unifi. From my point of view, even though Unifi is more expensive than Yes, it provides a more stable, reliable connection when compared to Yes. Yes can't even provide a stable skype connection. Whenever I wanna watch youtube, I always stuck at 360p. Never HD resolution. I really want to change to TIME internet but they don't cover my area.. :("
