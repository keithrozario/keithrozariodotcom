  "content": "GOSH!! I thought my issue with YES might be peculiar, I not no idea there are so many similar problem here... I experienced all the downsides Keith mentioned here hence I have decided I will terminated the contract once the two years is up.  Unfortunately just 2 months before the contract ends, the modem broken down, exactly same situation like Yung.  Went to Lot 10, waited for the manager for 4hrs.  They didn't even try to reboot it just asking me to buy a new one.  I said I won't pay for a new one since I have the intention to cancel the account.  I suggested if they can try and repair it, very poor customer service guy do nothing to help.  They said if I am not happy to buy a new one I should fill up the feedback form, leave the modem and they will get back to me on their suggestion.  However for more than one year no one get back to me and recently a lawyer letter demand for payment for the balance two months charges and few messages saying I am blacklisted!!! Why should I pay for something that I didn't use???? Very very disappointing how unreasonable and unhelpful YES is.  I felt utterly stupid choosing this very well-advertised internet service, real cheater like GB mentioned here.  To those who is reading this PLEASE DON\"T USE YES!!!"
