  "content": "I had the same issue a few years ago when they first launch the Eclipse smartphone and bought sign up for Zoom package thinking the allocated bandwidth should last a year but only 6 months.\n\nI wasted 500mb twice downloading a software update over 1.2G and then told about the 500mb cap. Burnt 1Gig for nothing, after that connection begin to slow and down time happen every day.\n\nUmobile, Tune Talk are scaled down service for the least affordable and it sucks for business on the go, Hotlink prepaid is a better option (premium) because it still work even at low signal connection, others don't except I haven't try Digi."
