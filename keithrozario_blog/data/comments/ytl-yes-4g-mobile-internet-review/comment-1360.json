  "content": "I had the worst case I guess. I am a student and I use quite a lot of internet due to the course I'm taking in which I decided to use YES. During the registration, the sales girl told me about the data plan and stuffs and asked me to sign a blue form saying that it is proof that I HAVE RECEIVED THE DEVICE ONLY. As I was in a rush, it wa smy fault of not reading further. After about 2 months, I couldnt use my huddle and I went to fix it. TWICE. and both times she said it will work and sorts and after that when I tried to go back there to do it, the store was gone. And I didn't use it anymore because it was troublesome. about 1 year later, they called me and threatened to pay RM1189.80 or YES will sue me and make sure I didn't get access to any loan including my studies loan. I was so confused when she said I have signed a contract when I couldn't think when I did. I swear I didn't hear a word coming out from the sales girl about contract and now i was forced to pay eventhough i hadn't used the Yes and more annoying, I was not provided the service that was suppose to be given. YES company is a cheater. Please Never, Ever Use YES. They cheat you into using it and use it to threatened you later on. Not to mention the operator was absolutely RUDE and not wanting to explain anything but kept on threatening that they would be glad to take legal actions especially since I was a student. I ended up being chased out of the house for a few weeks and had to find my own way to pay for something i didn't use. YES IS A CORRUPTED BUSSINESS!!I"
