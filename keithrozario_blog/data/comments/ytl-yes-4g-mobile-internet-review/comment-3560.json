  "content": "yeah its a bad service.. there is a fair usage policy and best effort basis in the tnc as well. it is not a premium service. its unifi but with higher price only. if finish quota then capped speed. then hell it gets so slow because with quota it is fast. so it is like unifi, if the network is down, then you wait. complaining also not going to help because its a cheap service. slow connection also cannot complain because theres this fair usage policy, u share the same bandwith with all the other ppl. same with yes. now if i want my own bandwith and not sharing it with the rest of the world i should take up premium service offered for companies. 1Mb already enough. pay 60k per month. no downtime got backup."
