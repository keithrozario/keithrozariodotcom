  "content": "With respect to the info on doctors, perhaps at least put a message saying something like \"If you are a doctor or registered with the Malaysian Medical Association since so-and-so date, the following data from the MMA is also in the leak: MMA registration number, etc, etc\".  That way, those who need to know that their data is at risk will know, and those who don't want to be identified as medical professionals wouldn't be identified by someone entering their IC number."
