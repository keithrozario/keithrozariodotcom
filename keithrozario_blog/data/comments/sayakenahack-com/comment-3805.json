  "content": "Hi Keith,\n\nI checked mine and there is a mobile number that registered using my IC but does not belong to me. I called the telco per say (DIGI) and they said they can't find any number registered under my IC and told me that even though the number starts from 016, that doesn't mean its under DIGI as number porting is very common nowadays. I then proceed to call MCMC and the lady says if you can get the full complete number then she can help to log a case.\n\nSo now the question is \na) Does this mean i need to call all telco to check?\nb) Can i get the full number ? because sayakenahack website only shows the format of 6016-*****12."
