  "content": "Thanks Keith for sharing and making the database access user-friendly for us regular Joes. With the recent issues on data leaks on both this massive personal particulars leak from those aforementioned companies in the article, and the CIMB Bank data tapes theft, we are now entering dangerous waters right here in Malaysia. Let's hope that all large corporations can better secure their data and take pre-emptive steps to prevent any thefts or hacks from happening. I understand that there's no foolproof method, but it is what we do from here on that matters. Speaking of which, being upfront and giving clarity on such situations are vital to the public eye. CIMB's move to create a special FAQ section on their site for the stolen tapes incident - is something exemplary that not many companies would do. And let's hope the aforementioned companies in the hack mentioned in the article can be just as honest as CIMB."
