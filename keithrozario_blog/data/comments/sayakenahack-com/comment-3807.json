I mean, even if the author states his actions/intentions to be genuine, this site is and will be collecting and storing your data you so willingly provide.  Think twice, the aforementioned 'leak' was in 2014, 3 years ago.  Unless your life has been clearly affected by this, there is no reason why you would enter your personal ID number into a website that is so poorly titled, that seems to be a scam itself."
