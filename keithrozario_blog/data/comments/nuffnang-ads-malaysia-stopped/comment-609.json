Hope you get more than me, and in truth the lifestyle blogs do better on Nuffnang than the tech blogs :). So I wouldn't be surprised if you do much better than Rm2.75.\n\nThat being said, please also use Google Analytics to really understand your traffic and visitor profiles more effectively :).\n\nHappy blogging."
