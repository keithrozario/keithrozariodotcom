Yeah, the amount could be really small, in most cases I think your website is a bit too niche for nuffnang, my theory is that nuffnang works well for the mainstream blogs about food, fashion, lifestyle..etc. Niche blogs about technology and fishing, struggle to make an impact.\n\n\nNot really nuffnangs fault, they're just doing what the general public want--and the general public don't fish! :(\n\n\nGlad the post helped you."
