  "content": "Hey Icyvirgorox (what does the nick mean?),\n\nJust visited your blog, you seem to be doing pretty well. Hope you get more than me, and in truth the lifestyle blogs do better on Nuffnang than the tech blogs :). So I wouldn't be surprised if you do much better than Rm2.75.\n\nThat being said, please also use Google Analytics to really understand your traffic and visitor profiles more effectively :).\n\nHappy blogging."
