  "content": "i tried setting up google adsense for my boardgame blog, but was auto rejected by google's robot filter. it seems the robot doesn't trust me because i have too many links at my blog. i create a tag for each game that i write about, and i just have an extremely long list of tags. i couldn't find a way to get a human google employee to check my blog out. needless to say, this lack of a human touch left me a little cold about google. hope you have better luck!"
