  "content": "If you're thinking of starting multiple blogs just to earn money, my advice is to stop. VERY few blogs actually generate sustainable income, and the few that do shouldn't be used as a benchmark for the rest.\n\nThe blogs that do make money, are usually very focused in delivering a specific type of news--starting multiple blogs isn't going to help in the long run as you'll be stretching your resources too thin to produce quality content.\n\nKeith"
