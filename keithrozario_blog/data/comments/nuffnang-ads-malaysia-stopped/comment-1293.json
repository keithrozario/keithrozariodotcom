  "content": "Keith,\n\nI agree. Nuffnang pays peanuts and it is nowhere near to the performance of adsense. I run a Malay tourism site and despite getting near 100,000 visitors a month, my monthly earning is similar to yours.\n\nTo bloggers new to ad monetization, ignore Nuffnang. It is far more easier and profitable to sell your worn out boots in mudah.my than generating 3 ringgit a month with Nuffnang. Yes, I am dead serious. "
