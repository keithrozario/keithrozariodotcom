  "content": "Doing a bit of research right now to better decide if I should continue using nuffnang or not. I'm using Nuffnang Philippines and I seem to be doing pretty well with a little over 100 uniques a day (according to their stats). My blog is a personal/fitness blog though so that's probably the main reason why it's like that. I used to have an earn money type blog that got 300-400 uniques a day and when I ran nuffnang on that I got nothing lol. Granted i only tested for a bout a week or two but still...\n\n\n\nI also read another pinoy blogger who wrote a post about nuffnang (or it might have been from a local forum) that nuffnang advertisers aren't really big fans of tech blogs so that's prolly why it didn't work out so good for your blog."
