  "content": "Hi Keith,\n\nThis information is most fruitful. After being fully rejected by Google I have been seeking alternatives to advertising solutions. Quite recently I put up Nuffnang for my sports fishing site and i have been puzzled by their methods. \n\nQuite simply i received feedback from few of my readers that they have been \"helping\" me in a certain way online. The site says that they will register payment immediately but its still Zero. Could it be that the amount be very little?\n\n\nI clock about 600 - 1200 unique visitors a day. (a lot more 600's than thousands. Quiet over the weekends)\n\nhttp://fishmalaysia.com/"
