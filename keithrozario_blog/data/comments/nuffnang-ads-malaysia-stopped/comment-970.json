  "content": "Hi Ain Nia,\n\n\nI try hard not to discourage people, but you need to set some realistic expectations when it comes to this. You currently have 19 unique hits a day, meaning that over the course of a month, you get around 600 unique viewers. That's not a small amount, but it's not big either. You claim you want to earn at least Rm100/day, which means each viewer on your blog should earn you about 15 cents, I hate to disappoint, but nobody gets 15 cents per viewer.\n\n\nPlease try to patient, and grow your blog rather than aim to make money. At the end of the day, a blog should be a place for you to enjoy and write about things you're truly passionate about--not a place where you try to earn a lot of money.\n\n\nIf you go into the blogging experience looking to purely earn money, you'll be terrible upset at the end...\n\n\nNobody will pay you the kind of money you want, based on the 19 unique viewers you have per day. So grow your traffic, then start thinking about how to monetize it.\n\n\nKeith"
