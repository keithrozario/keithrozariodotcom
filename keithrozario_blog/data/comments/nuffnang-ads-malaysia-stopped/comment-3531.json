  "content": "Actually i'm new to this blogger world .. I saw everyone put nuffnang ads at their sides of their blogs so i become interested in it ( So i clicked it.. tadaaa ) ... I just registered nuffnang 2 days ago n then i saw someone shared about this article ..\n\nThe funny is i nvr thoughts we can gain money from this ads ( i thought this ads , it's just for \"add a widget\" things n it makes looks beautiful n most of it \"ahhh it's to check traffics data how many user comes to our blogs/websites ) . Hahaha . Sorry for the newb-ness.. The main point So i've got confuse which is the best ? They said komli was the best one n also nuffnang not bad either or other said \" just use both lah \" ( with malaysia accents of course )\n\nSo after i've seen so many reviews and i'm totally \"blank\" ( What in the world just going on tho ) \"a lil bit of anime reactions\" haha .. Btw your post are awesome , i really do enjoy it .. It sounds like crazy right ? ( double writer personalities ) haha.. Yaa I really dooo enjoy it . As a blogger .. Just keep it up with a good post .
