  "content": "I quite agree with your suggestion to publish the findings and documentation of IT projects in the public shere, and use crowdsourcing to evaluate them! Unless....there is something to hide.... I am seeing some countries adopting the white paper policy whereby before they agree on implementing something big, they will first publish a white paper on the subject and invite the public to comment. I feel this way - we can ensure tax payers money are chanelled to the right places."
