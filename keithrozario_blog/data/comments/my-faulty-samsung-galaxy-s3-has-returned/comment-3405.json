  "content": "Hello Everyone\n\nI am from India and using Samsung Galaxy Y. Some days ago, I\nwent to Samsung Service Centre, as my phone was fallen in water. And they\nchecked that, and told me that the phone touch and jack are destroyed and have\nto replace these. I said okay coz my phone was under warranty. But they told me\nthat they would charge me 4000/-. As it was near the half amount of new phone's\nprice. Then I went to another service centre and they told me to charge 1600/-.\nSo I gave my phone to them as they were charging fewer amounts then first one.\nBut my some of friends told me that they have charged me unnecessarily. Because\nif our any product is under warranty, the company for their repair. So I\ncontact the centre for same but they didn't respond me for my issue. So, I\nfiled my complaint in <a>Consumer\nCourt</a>. I just hope for great help from their side as soon as\npossible. I just shared my experience to aware you guys. I hope it worked.\n\nThanks!"
