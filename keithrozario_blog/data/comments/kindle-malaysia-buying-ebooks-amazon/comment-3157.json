The charge is reflect in dollars, but usually a double charge.\nhttp://pic.twitter.com/PtpUWGtTWT\n\nWhen purchasing books from either UK or US, both can be purchased by changing your address under \"Manage Your Kindle.\"\n\n**Devices:\n\nUsing Kindle on other devices is also easier, but obvious the hampering point is the battery.\n\nCould a nice addition for people who don't want to go through the hassle of buying a new device."
