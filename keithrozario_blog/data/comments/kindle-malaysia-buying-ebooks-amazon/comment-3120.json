  "content": "I'm not entirely sure if Read it Later works well on the kindle, but i can easily read my mails on gmail with no issues.\n\nPDFs don't really display well on the Kindle, at least not as nicely as the native kindle formats, so for website reading and PDF reading, I'd recommend a more functional color screen tablet rather than a Kindle Touch."
