  "content": "Hi Keith,  Just read your review.  I bought a Kobo e-reader from Australia, last December.  After using it for about 3 months, the screen broke up in lines.  I wrote to Kobo Australia and was given a replacement unit (which they parceled to an Australian address I gave them) with no extra cost to me.  My uncle whose address I used, sent the device to me in June, 2012.  This morning when I switched on the Kobo, it happened again! - the screen had black streaks running across it!!  If you read the reviews on Kobo you'll know that this happens to a lot of people.  I was lucky in the sense that it was still within the warranty period.  Anyway,  I'm thinking of switching to a Kindle instead.  Read some of the blogs and I understand Kindle has the same problem.  Just wanted to know how long you've had the Kindle and have you come across this problem.  I do not want to go through that again with Kindle.  Thank you."
