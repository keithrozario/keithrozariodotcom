  "content": "Hi James,\n\nYes it's more than safe. The deliver content to your Kindle is over your Wi-Fi (or 3G) network. Once you're kindle is connected to the internet you can sync your subscriptions 'on air'.\n\nThe deliver content to Kindle doesn't go through your PC, it's direct from your Kindle to Amazon.\n\nHope that helps."
