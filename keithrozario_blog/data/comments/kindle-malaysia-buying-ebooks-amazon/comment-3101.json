  "content": "Hi, thanks for sharing your expertise and experience here. I am in UK and planning to give a new Kindle to my niece in Malaysia. If I set up an account and purchase ebook here in UK, would she be able to download it in Malaysia via wifi? Or even if I were to give her my Amazon login ID and password, would that be possible (assuming that there is no IP address issue)? Thanks."
