  "content": "Hi, I'm so glad that I found your article. I'm thinking of getting a kindle soon and this is just the right information for me. However, considering that I'm a non tech savvy I still don't understand how to change to US IP address. So, I checked out the kindlemalaysia website. They say that if we buy kindle from them, they will register an Amazon account with valid US Debit Card and US billing address. That means, I don't have to register for another amazon account,right? and can I use Maybank Amex to purchase books afterwards or i still have to use the Use debit card? I'm still confused with this whole process. Thanks for the help.:)\n\nregister an Amazon\n Account with valid US Debit Card &#038; US Billing Address - See more \nat: \nhttp://kindlemalaysia.com/buy-kindle-ebooks-amazon-malaysia/#sthash.iXdV5Vs3.dpuf\nregister an Amazon\n Account with valid US Debit Card &#038; US Billing Address - See more \nat: \nhttp://kindlemalaysia.com/buy-kindle-ebooks-amazon-malaysia/#sthash.iXdV5Vs3.dpuf"
