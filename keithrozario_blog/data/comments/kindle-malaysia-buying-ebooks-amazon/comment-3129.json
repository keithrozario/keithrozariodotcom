  "content": "Hi Keith, thanks for the informative article. You said that you are using Amazon EC2. Can you please elaborate on that? Which part of the EC2 service are you using to access the Amazon Kindle store? Right now, I am based in Malaysia and can purchase Kindle books because the last time I used the purchasing service, I was in the US. I don't know how long it'll take Amazon to detect my Malaysian IP this time, but I want to use a US IP before it detects and blocks me from purchasing Kindle books."
