  "content": "Hi. Thanks for your indepth review! I am also thinking of getting a Kindle [Kindle Touch Wifi] in KL.\n\nHowever, my main use case for an Ebook reader would be to read website articles and pdfs. In particular, I plan to use services like Read It Later or SendToReader, which send these webpages to the Kindle through email -&#062; they send it to the&#160;@kindle or @free.kindle email address.&#160;\nHence, I want to ask you if it is possible to use such services and receive emails to my Kindle Touch in Malaysia, through a Wifi connection [or USB connection].\n\nI would really appreciate your kind help in this matter. I am also an avid reader and would really like a way to read online articles on a Kindle. Thanks!"
