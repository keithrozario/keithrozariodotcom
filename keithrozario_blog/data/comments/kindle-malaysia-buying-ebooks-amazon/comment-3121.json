  "content": "I bought the Kindle in April, and it's been nothing but Amazing these past 4 months. My wife reads it off and on, we took it on our recent trip to Australia and it lasted the whole two weeks without a recharge for about 1-2 hours of reading per day. Overall it's a solid device you can't go wrong."
