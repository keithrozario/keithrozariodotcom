But the main thing I wanted to ask was whether you are able to access your \n@kindle or @free.kindle email address through your Kindle, when connected to Wifi, in Malaysia.\nI wanted to know whether there would be any issues [such as IP problems that would require VPN, or authentication issues, etc], or if you could easily receive and open the emails on your Kindle.Kindly let me know. Thanks!"
