  "content": "My concern is affordability &amp; reliability (quality of service) - during #streamyx (copper-line), the problems is quality of service not price. TM received many complain about it. I also logged many complain to MCMC. With copper-line, It reach it technical limit and price at the time is quite expensive. However, investment in international fibre-optic cable &amp; local in under HSBB should enable Malaysia to enjoy cheaper &amp; better quality of service. The price of bandwidth (international) has reduce significantly and with investment in local internet exchange, it also contribute reduction to cost of internet. \n\nYou have to look further down in our poverty line or minimum wage as new minimum wage in Malaysia is RM900/month (2013). The price should be around 5% of minimum wage for basic package like Unifi 5Mb (with option to unbundle especially Set-up box).\n\n\n\nOne major in this issue is monopoly issue:\n1. TM enjoy monopoly position (can't be touch by current anti-monopoly law).\n2. Long term contract (2 year) with no option to switch.\n3. (1) create last-mile issue as you should able to change you service provider the same way you change your mobile phone company service.\n\n\nIt take time to roll out HSBB to national level, but we can never forget the unfortunate one."
