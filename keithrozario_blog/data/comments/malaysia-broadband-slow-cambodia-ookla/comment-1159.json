  "content": "Valid points. If we assume the minimum wage is Rm900, then 5% would be around RM45, still high for someone in that income bracket, I wouldn't support subsidies, but I do support more broadband penetration throughout Malaysia.\n\n\nTM has a monopoly, that's further entrenched by their 2 year contract. There should be legislation allowing for broandband providers to provide non-contract subscriptions. That being said, other telcos and ISPs in Malaysia are doing a good job in competing with TM on data rates and price.\n\n\nAs always, thanks for the comment Syawal."
