Privacy is about sharing only the information you want to share and that’s based on an individual preference. If you don’t like someone tracking your IP and search information, then that’s perfectly acceptable. However, I should warn you that my ONE nuffnang ad here is no where near the amount of information you share with ads on other sites. Check out a previous post of mine which details how to track which sites are tracking you. [&#8230;]"
