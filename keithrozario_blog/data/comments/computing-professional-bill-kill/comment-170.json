  "content": "Hey Dzof,\n\nThanks for the comment.\n\nThe quality of fresh grads is definitely suspect, not just in IT but all industries as well, including Engineering, Law and even Medicine.\n\nMy opinion is that the only way to solve this is to ensure that the university graduates, and the 'accredited' universities are up to standard. So that graduates come to interview and can tell you how to heapsort and how to write a SELECT statement.\n\nIn the end, I also must admit that fresh graduates need to be trained by their employing companies, and companies should cut fresh graduates some slack. \n\nMore to the point though, I don't see how having an exam after you completed 3 years of studying and have a degree going to improve the standards. All it will do is have fresh graduates start cramming for a newer exam, and If I don't have a degree and pass the exam, would I be considered a professional?\n"
