This is the source code for [keithRozario.com](https://keithrozario.com). The blog started off as a Wordpress blog in 2011, and remained on Wordpress all the way to 2026, before I finally converted it to Hugo with the help of  `gemini-cli`.

We use a slightly modified terminal theme for Hugo, which gives the blog a slightly techy look :)

Now it's a Hugo blog hosted on Github pages, and whose source code resides in this repository.

Instructions for how to make blog post are in `instructions.md`

The chat I used to migrate the blog to Hugo is in  `gemini-chat.md`

## Note to self

I wouldn't have been able to migrate this blog without LLM support. I tried a few times over the years but failed and stumbled. It's really amazing what having an LLM can do.
